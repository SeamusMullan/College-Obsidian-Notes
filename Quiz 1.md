> [!question] Which of the following represents an ordered outcome with replacement?
> a) Ordered samples with replacement
> b) Ordered samples without replacement
> c) Unordered samples with replacement
> d) Unordered samples without replacement
>> [!success]- Answer
>> d) Unordered samples without replacement

> [!question] What is the probability of selecting a 3 followed by a 4 in the scenario with 5 tickets where the first ticket is not replaced before the second is picked?
>> [!success]- Answer
>> 1/25

> [!question] If we have 4 chips selected randomly from a box with 100 chips, 90 are normal and 10 are defective. What is the probability that the sample has no defects?
>> [!success]- Answer
>> $\binom{90}{4} / \binom{100}{4}$

> [!question] What is the difference between a combination and a permutation?
>> [!success]- Answer
>> A combination represents an unordered outcome, while a permutation represents an ordered outcome.

> [!question] In the text, what is the total number of outcomes when taking two tickets without replacement?
>> [!success]- Answer
>> 20

> [!question] Is it correct that in a box with 5 tickets numbered 1 to 5, the number of possibilities when taking two tickets without replacement is $5^2$?
>> [!success]- Answer
>> True

> [!question] What is the probability of selecting a chip that is either normal or defective, in any order, 3 times from a box with 100 chips, 90 are normal and 10 are defective?
>> [!success]- Answer
>> $\binom{100}{3} / \binom{180}{3}

> [!question] What is the formula for calculating permutations?
>> [!success]- Answer
>> $nPr = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$
