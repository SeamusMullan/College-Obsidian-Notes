# Counting n Stuff

Counting started with fingers (big surprise)
French are the reason we got decimal stuff..


Useful Java crap

`int` is represented with 32 bits
`long` is 64 bits
`short` is like 16 bits idk

in binary from right to left the numbers represent powers of 2
the leftmost bit represents negativity, specifically the value `-2,147,483,647`

**Little Endian**
- ARM
- Java
The leftmost bit is the highest value

**Big Endian**
- C/C++
- Depends on the system
Biggest number is left bit in rightmost quadrant of all bits


**Unicode / UTF-8**

Encodes code points in 1-4 bytes
