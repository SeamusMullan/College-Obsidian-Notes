# Programs Processes and Processors

#### What is a program
A collection of instructions specifying a defined sequence of execution. It basically represents an algorithm to be performed.

A compiler takes written code and turns it into machine instructions (assembly) for specific processor types (x86, x64, arm, etc) which get stored in object files.

Executable files are then created from a collection of object files. These are stored in platform specific formats . e.g. `.exe` for Windows, `.app` for MacOS

#### What is a process
A process is a single instance of a program in action. It is an abstraction in Operating Systems that allows them to represent code to be executed, i.e. when code from a program is being run, a process exists for that program.

Processes also have an **execution context**, a list of things the program requires while it is running (libraries, OS specific code, etc.).

Processes are **Dynamic Transient Entities** meaning that their lifetime can vary from a few milliseconds to months, some processes are considered **persistent**, meaning they never end. This is usually used for system services like UI, I/O management, Checking for updates, etc.

Operating Systems are made up of multiple processes functioning at once to provide a series of functions that can function at once and with each other.

#### What is a processor
A processor is the agent that runs processes by executing their instructions. Most devices have a single processor (usually a CPU) which reads memory, fetches instructions, runs them and increments the instruction counter (like a check list).

Modern processors can also have multiple *cores* meaning they can execute multiple processes in tandem. This makes them faster at most tasks since the processes can avail of the multiple cores to do things simultaneously.

#### Processor Time Sharing (Ready and Blocked Processes)

We can almost always expect a device to be running more processes than the number of cores/processors it has.

This is an issue that we solve by dividing CPU time between **ready processes**, meaning when a process has something to do, we say it is *ready* and then allocate it time to 'use' the CPU to do calculations.

Sometimes we have specific programs that require data from other processes to function, e.g. we need to read a file from a USB before we manipulate it.

We can say that the waiting processes are **blocked** and when the data is ready / they have data to process they can be redefined as **ready**.

# Representing Process Abstractions

The main job of an Operating System is to manage processes. Namely they **Create, Control and Terminate** processes, while also managing their *execution environment*.

#### Resource Allocation

The Operating System needs to Allocate Memory, CPU time and other requirements to processes. It also needs to stop other processes from accessing information it shouldn't be able to see. The OS provides ways for processes to share specific information between each other to allow safe communication between processes.

#### Process Control Blocks
For each process, the OS maintains a **Process Control Block** / **Process Descriptor** which describes what the processes are doing, what point they reached during execution and what resources it has / should have access to.

PCBs are used to keep track of ***Execution Context***, which is basically all the relevant information about a process, namely:
- Process Identification Data
- Processor State
- Process Control Data

# Process Lifecycle

The PCB may be moved into different Queues over its lifetime depending on the state of the process.

These Queues hold processes waiting for specific information / access to resources which get serviced using a *scheduling algorithm*. The PCB represents the process one of the OS queues.

There will also be times when the process needs the CPU to run specific instructions (ready) and other states where it's awaiting other resources (blocked / waiting)

# Communication with the Operating System

***Hardware Interrupts*** allow external hardware to indicate they require attention / have completed tasks. These interrupts are required for a system to effectively manage a large number of external devices.

Usually interrupt controllers or other support chips are used to help manage communication with other devices by identifying interrupts and notifying the CPU.

#### Multitasking

Hardware interrupts are also required to implement a *multitasking environment*. When tasks are scheduled to be run, they get given a timer and if it runs out, the CPU triggers an interrupt which stops the current process and picks the next scheduled one. This stops a process hogging all the CPU resources indefinitely.

#### Triggering OS code

Code in operating systems can also be called using an interrupt. This is important in scenarios where a process needs to access information from an I/O device or another OS managed resource.

This means the Operating System is **event driven*** meaning that the OS only ever does things in response to events.

There are 3 kinds of events that can trigger OS code:
- Hardware Interrupts
	- Raised by hardware devices that can occur at any time.
 
- Software Interrupts (Traps)
	- Are generated by program instructions in order to invoke OS functionality.
 
- Exceptions: 
	- Faults or Errors that occur during the execution of an instruction, such as dividing by 0 or a missing memory page/page fault.
	- The operating system can fix some temporary faults like that but exception errors will cause a process to be terminated.

### Processor Execution Modes

To guarantee that hardware is protected, the processors in a system need to contain certain instructions that can't be accessed by normal users.

These two modes are usually ***User Mode*** and ***Supervisor Mode***.

While processes are operating in user mode, they can only run specific operations. To execute system code or access hardware, the process needs to make a ***System Call*** (a.k.a syscall).

The Syscall then triggers the CPU to run in supervisor mode, allowing OS code to be run with full control over the system. When the instructions are finished the CPU is set to user mode.

Processes are usually split into rings, detailing the amount of control over the system the process has. The most significant of these being the kernel which oversees and manages all other processes.

#### How do System Calls work?

System calls are usually implement in ***wrapper libraries*** that are distributed by  Operating System developers like Microsoft and Apple. These libraries are available to developers to implement in their programs.

They are platform specific (e.g. MacOS and Windows will have different function abstractions, resulting in a difference in the compiled executables).

When the program is compiled into an executable format, these system calls can be run using the OS libraries on the system.

These libraries and System Calls are one of the most important things in developing applications since they allow our programs to access hardware and other system resources safely.

When a processor encounters a software interrupt instruction as part of the process’s code, it essentially traps the process execution. The processor will stop executing the current process, and save its CPU state in its PCB structure.

These mechanisms are integral to the safe execution of userspace processes since it allows them to access critical resources like files, user input and other resources without granting userspace processes full and complete access to the instruction set provided on the CPU.
