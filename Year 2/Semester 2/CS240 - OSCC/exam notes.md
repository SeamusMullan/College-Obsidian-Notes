tendency to do practical work well, get help and then perform poorly on exam assuming they only need 10%

not really trick questions, just understanding of terminology and technical details
not bullet points, explain topics and terminology for better marks

make writing legible, make it easy for examiners, avoid pencil

explain topics as if you were teaching. dont impress, just answer

dont waste time writing irrelevant details (exam technique 101 xd)

aka. read the mf question

not *all* points required to get 10 on a q, if good in general it should be fine. Dont bloat with bs.

write what you are confident about.
