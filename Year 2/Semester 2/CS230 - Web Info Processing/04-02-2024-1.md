# HTML & CSS

## Structure

### HTML
akin to 'skeleton' of the website.
Uses tags to define data sections, eg:
- `<p>` $\to$ Paragraph
- `<h1>` to `<h6>` $\to$ Headers (size 1-6 where 1 is largest)
- etc.
tags have starts `<{tag}>` and ends `</{tag}>`

#### Important Tags

`<!DOCTYPE html>`
- says that this file should be interpreted as html

`<html>`
- used to define what section of the file is html

`<head>`
- represents the settings about the page
- place where styles should be imported (see CSS)

`<body>`
- contains visible content, eg paragraphs and headings

`<table>`
- Contains rows `<tr>` and columns (which get added automatically)
- within these we use `<td>` for table data
```html
<table>
	<tr> <!-- Column Titles since Row 0 is technically a title-->
		<td>Col A</td>
		<td>Col B</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr> <!-- data for above titles -->
		<td>Col Data A</td>
		<td>Col Data B</td>
	</tr>
</table>
```

`<html>`

#### HTML Example (click on the text to view html)

<html>
	<head>
		<title>This is an example title</title>
		 <!-- Titles do not show in Obsidian btw -->
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>This is a test paragraph</p>
	</body>
</html>

## CSS

Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) are used to change the appearance of the main HTML tags. CSS has a lot of popular existing *frameworks?* namely **Bootstrap** and **Tailwind**, which can be implemented by add a single line of code in out `<head>` tag

Using Tailwind

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<title>This is an example title</title>
		<!-- this line includes our own css file -->
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>This is a test paragraph</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

Using our own css file

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<title>This is an example title</title>
		<!-- this line includes Tailwind as our CSS -->
		<script src="https://unpkg.com/@tailwindcss/browser@4"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>This is a test paragraph</p>
	</body>
</html>

```

You can absolutely make your own `.css` files to make custom styling for your website. We can change how specific tags look, what they look like when hovered over, etc. We can also include animations, albeit a bit more complex, to make your website *really* stand out.

#### Classes and IDs

Classes and IDs allow us to group together specific elements that we want to be styled the same. It helps stop repetitive code which is usually good.
#### CSS Example code

```css

/* Make our paragraph text off-white and 14px tall */
p{
	color: #f0f0f0;
	font-size: 14px;
}

/* Make our largest header a darkish purple, make it bold */
h1{
	color: #ff0066;
	font-weight: bold;
}

.SpecialHeading{
	color: #0000FF;
	font-size: 128px;
}

```

#### Using Classes And IDs in HTML

```html
<!-- Setup for page -->
<h1 class="SpecialHeading">
	Some Example Heading
</h1>
<!-- Rest of Page -->
```
## JavaScript

JavaScript is a curse and should have never been brought into the programming world, but it's here now so we have to suffer..

JavaScript is used to add functionality to our websites, e.g. making buttons show elements, make web requests and do other things.

To implement JavaScript *in* our html file we can use a `<script>` tag.

> [!CAUTION]
> Be wary since other people browsing the web can see your JavaScript code if it isn't obfuscated. Therefore its SUPER unsafe to do any private / sensitive data processing using inline JavaScript.

#### HTML + CSS + JavaScript Example

See the examples folder for this lecture to find the actual files!

HTML (index.html)
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Counter</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Click the button to increment the counter:</h1>
  <button id="counter-btn">Click me!</button>
  <p id="counter"></p>
  <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

CSS (styles.css):
```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

button {
  font-size: 20px;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  margin: 20px 0;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
}

#counter {
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

JavaScript (app.js):
```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  const counterBtn = document.getElementById('counter-btn');
  const counterDisplay = document.getElementById('counter');
  let count = 0;

  counterBtn.addEventListener('click', function() {
    count++;
    counterDisplay.textContent = count;
  });
});
```
