**Cs355 last lecture**

  

Exam paper :

  

Similar to last 3-4 years, almost identicalÂ 

  

4qs, marked out of all 4

  

Q1 regular language and cfg

3 subparts

First 2, pumping lemma, prove language non regular, similar to slides except two cars n and m have some condition

Note that p for pumping length is important

N-m less than 7 (or similar), pick appropriately

  

Q2, context free grammar

Given one, explain why in chomsky normal form

  

Second part, challenging, cyk algorithm

Given string, table stuff

Show string can be generated by grammar using cyk algorithm

  

No equation on exam, remember it

  

  

Given language with rules, prove lang is not context free. Use pumping lemma

  

CYK is hardest since you need to know eqn, emphasis on pumping lemma on context free and regular languges

  

Q3

PDAs

  

Know diff between pda and npda, just give some pda that acceprs language

  

2 languages draw pda

  

Similar to CA and ones explained in lectures on pen / paper

  

Be careful reading and understanding cases, epsilons etc

  

Part 2, given two langs, sketch proof to show intersection is not context free

  

Highly related to pumping lemme for context free

Anbncn is not context free, prove same

  

Q4

Turing machines

Language given, some description

  

First, high level description of turing machine

See slide 23 (decidable languages)

  

Second, draw transition diagram for turing machine

  

Finally, given test input, show algorithm accepts / not accepts

  

Two turing machines in lecture, not exactly same, follow notes from pen / paper work and should be ok
