# Nondeterminism

$$\begin{matrix}
NFA=DFA+\text{nondeterminism} + \epsilon\text{-transitions}
\end{matrix}$$

We can show that every language recognised by an NFA is also recognised by a DFA.


Nondeterministic machines can make choices, but magically each choice leads to acceptance aka it's right. Basically whenever the machine has a choice it makes the right one.

Alt view: Tree of possibilities, root is start of computation, branches are choices, machine accepts if at least one leaf is accepting state.

These choices are enriched with $\epsilon\text{-transitions}$ ie they can move without consuming symbols.

every nfa has an equvalent dfa.
