## Expression Simplification

K-Maps. makes simplification easier

$$f(A,B,C) = (A+B)(A+\bar{B})(\bar{A}+C)$$

Simplify Above Expression, you can multiply out terms akin to algebra, i.e.
$$(A+B)(A+\bar{B}) = AA+A\bar{B}+AB+\bar{B}B$$
$$A+A \bar{B} + AB$$
$$A$$

part 2
$$A(\bar{A}+C)$$
$$A\bar{A} + AC$$
A and A bar = 0
$$AC$$

### Karnaugh Maps (K Maps)

Graphical tool to make process of minimisation much simpler.
*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnaugh_map*

With a truth table for a function with variables $A,B,C$ we draw a box with the same number of sub boxes as we have outputs on our truth table (8 in this case).

In order to determine which minterms go into which box we go in the order (from $m_0 \to m_7$)

The columns go in the order 00, 01, 11, 10 (left to right), this is the **grey code sequence**
the rows go from 0 to 1 (downwards)

The implications this has just means we swap the last 2 columns in this case.

| 0   | 2   | 6   | 4   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 3   | 7   | 5   |
We can then fill in our K map with the terms from our function where it is equal to 1, shown below

|     |     |       |             |
| --- | --- | ----- | ----------- |
|     |     | $ABC$ | $A\bar{B}C$ |
Since we have now plotted the function in our K map, we can express the function in a simplified form as a sum of terms, i.e.

$$f = A\bar{B}C + ABC$$
The advantage of a K Map form is that we can immediately see from the K Map that the 1's are next to each other. 

This means we can merge the groups together (in sizes of power of 2 **only**) to get a single product term by eliminating the variable that changes, in this case B, shown below

$$f = AC + AC = AC$$

This yields the same result as the boolean algebra we did before but in a *lot* less steps.

### Gray Code

The axes for the K Maps are labeled using the Gray Code, which is done in the following way.

The idea is that as you move from each character to the next, only one variable changes


| A   | B   | C   | \|------\| | A   | B   | C   |
| --- | --- | --- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | 0   | 0   | \|------\| | 0   | 0   |     |
|     | 0   | 1   | \|------\| | 0   | 1   |     |
|     | 1   | 1   | \|------\| | 1   | 1   |     |
|     | 1   | 0   | \|------\| | 1   | 0   |     |
A single digit Gray code would be simple 0 and 1, if you want a 2 digit gray code, you draw a line under the single code and reflect it, ie

0
1
-
1
0

Then you add zeros to the left above and 1s to the left below

| 0   | 0   |
| --- | --- |
| 0   | 1   |
|     |     |
| 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   |
to make a gray code with 3 variables we can do the same process again, notice there is only ever a change in one of the variables.


### K Maps (continued)

The size of a K Map depends on the number of variables in the function, above we saw an example with 3 (had 8 boxes in the k map)

Note: when a variable is being read from a K map, if the value is 1, use a normal variable, if it is 0, use the inverse ($0\to \bar{X}, 1\to X$)

a 2 variable k map would only have 4 boxes
a 4 variable k map would have 16

we can represent the number of boxes as the following
$$\text{Number of Boxes} = 2^{n},\text{ where n is the number of variables}$$

Below is the layout for a 4 Variable function in K Map form

### Example

$$f(A,B,C) = \sum m(x,y,z)$$ ???


|     | AB  | 00  | 01  | 11  | 10  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C   | //  | //  | //  | //  | //  |
| 0   | //  |     | 1   |     |     |
| 1   | //  |     |     | 1   | 1   |

$$f = \bar{A}B\bar{C} + A\bar{B}C + ABC$$
Looking at the K Map we can merge the bottom right terms which reflect the last 2 terms in our equation, i.e.

$$f = \bar{A}B\bar{C} + AC$$ (note we remove $\bar{B}$ since it changed between the 2 terms)

***

### Example 2

|     | AB  | 00  | 01  | 11  | 10  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C   | //  | //  | //  | //  | //  |
| 0   | //  | 1   |     |     |     |
| 1   | //  | 1   |     |     |     |
We can group the two ones together and remove the variable c (since it changes, and write this as)

$$f = \bar{A}\bar{B}$$
### Example 3


|     | AB  | 00  | 01  | 11  | 10  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C   | //  | //  | //  | //  | //  |
| 0   | //  |     |     | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | //  |     |     |     |     |
We can group the two ones together and remove the variable B (since it changes, and write this as)

$$f = A\bar{C}$$

***

### Reminder

We need to keep the grouping limited to sizes of powers of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, etc)

Assuming the below k map, the expression for the function would be as follows

since we have all 1's we can actually take a group of 8, we eliminate 3 variables

|     | AB  | 00  | 01  | 11  | 10  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C   | //  | //  | //  | //  | //  |
| 0   | //  | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | //  | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   |
$$
f = 1
$$
This also makes sense when you look at a truth table for this function, since no matter the input, we get 1 as an output.


### Example 4


|     | AB  | 00  | 01  | 11  | 10  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C   | //  | //  | //  | //  | //  |
| 0   | //  |     |     |     |     |
| 1   | //  | 1   |     |     | 1   |
Technically the ones above are adjacent, so we can actually group them together, meaning we can write this function as

$$
f = \bar{B}C
$$
### Example 5


|     | AB  | 00  | 01  | 11  | 10  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C   | //  | //  | //  | //  | //  |
| 0   | //  |     |     |     | 1   |
| 1   | //  |     |     | 1   | 1   |
Because the 3 ones are together, we cant express this as a singular expression or group them all together, meaning we need to write this as a sum of 2 groups, note we can also include the same 1 in multiple groups, meaning we get 2 AND terms OR'ed together

$$
f = A\bar{B} + AC 
$$

### Example 6 (exam?)


|     | AB  | 00  | 01  | 11  | 10  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CD  | //  | //  | //  | //  | //  |
| 00  | //  | 1   |     |     |     |
| 01  | //  | 1   |     | 1   | 1   |
| 11  | //  | 1   |     | 1   | 1   |
| 10  | //  | 1   |     |     |     |
$$
f = \bar{A}\bar{B}\bar{C}\bar{D} + \bar{A}\bar{B}\bar{C}D\dots
$$
This ends up being a really complicated sum of products equation, on the K map we can use the visual tools to simplify this function quickly, we can group the 4 ones on the right to make a single term.

Since A and D are both constant, we know the term will only include A and D

$$
\text{ ones on right } \to AD
$$

Looking at the left of the K map we have 4 ones in a vertical line, which we can represent as the following

since C and D are the only variables changing we only include A and B in our term, which is 
$$\bar{A}\bar{B}$$

Finally we can simplify the full function to the expression (in a form of sum of products)
$$f=AD+\bar{A}\bar{B}$$

***
### Example 7


|     | AB  | 00  | 01  | 11  | 10  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CD  | //  | //  | //  | //  | //  |
| 00  | //  | 1   |     |     | 1   |
| 01  | //  |     | 1   | 1   |     |
| 11  | //  |     | 1   | 1   |     |
| 10  | //  | 1   |     |     | 1   |
We can group the middle 4 ones and the 4 corner ones to form the expression

$$
f = BD + \bar{B}\bar{D}
$$

***
## Finding the Minimal sum of products expression

after we find the expression from a k map, we need to *know* its the minimal sum

We can algorithmically approach this by doing the following steps

### Step 0: Definition :(

**Implicant**: A product term that can be used in a sum of products expression.

We can express any equation in the sum of products form as a sum of implicants as well, since any product term is an implicant and *might* be used in a sum of products expression.

**Minterms:** Terms from K Maps that don't exclude any variables (i.e. groups of one)

### Step 1: Find all possible implicants of the function

Simply list out all the implicants, doings lists based on group sizes (1, 2, 4, 8, etc)

### Step 2: Identify Prime Implicants

Prime implicants are groups of ones that are not subsets of larger groups, i.e. a one that isnt in a group other than itself, a group of 2 inside a group of 4, a group of 4 inside a group of 8...


### Step 3: Find Essential Prime Implicants

Essential Prime Implicants contain a unique 1 (i.e. the ones that arent in other prime implicants)

### Step 4: Pray you didn't mess up

Now that you have all the prime implicants that cover all the ones in the K Map, you can just sum them and hope you did everything right!

## Don't Care Terms

Represented as an X instead of 0 or 1, basically we don't care what the variable is at that point

|     | AB  | 00  | 01  | 11  | 10  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CD  | //  | //  | //  | //  | //  |
| 00  | //  |     |     |     |     |
| 01  | //  |     | X   | 1   |     |
| 11  | //  |     | 1   | 1   |     |
| 10  | //  |     |     |     |     |
In this example we can interpret the X as a 1 and make a group of 4

|     | AB  | 00  | 01  | 11  | 10  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CD  | //  | //  | //  | //  | //  |
| 00  | //  |     |     |     |     |
| 01  | //  |     | 1   |     |     |
| 11  | //  |     | 1   | X   |     |
| 10  | //  |     |     |     |     |
In this example we can let X = 0 and just get a group of 2
