## Recap
### Previously Covered Topics:
- **4-bit Carry Lookahead Adder** using sum-of-products to generate carries in parallel.
- **Multiplexer, Demultiplexer, Decoder, Encoder circuits** operation and applications.
- **Tri-State Buffers** operation and managing contention for shared output paths.

## Sequential Logic Design

### Combinational vs Sequential Logic
- **Combinational Logic**: 
    - Outputs depend purely on current inputs.
    - If inputs change, output changes after a small propagation delay.
    - Example: Basic gate circuits where outputs reflect input values.
  
- **Sequential Logic**:
    - Output depends on both inputs **and** the current state (memory).
    - Triggered by a clock signal.
    - If no clock signal is present, the flip-flops in the circuit retain their current state.

## Flip-Flops

### D Flip-Flop (Data Latch)
- Stores input data and changes output only on a clock signal edge.
- **Time-Dependent** behavior: Outputs remain stable even if inputs change, unless clocked.
  
### Master-Slave J-K Flip-Flop
- More robust, addressing some of the limitations of simple D Flip-Flops.
- **Master-Slave Design**: 
    - Master flip-flop responds when clock is high.
    - Slave flip-flop responds when clock is low.
    - Ensures more reliable data storage and state transitions.

### Bistable Circuit Example
- Assume initial inputs: \( A = 1 \), \( B = 1 \), \( C = 0 \), \( D = 1 \).
- With inputs unchanged, output values remain stable. 
- State transitions over time are described by propagation delays (denoted as \( \Delta t \)).

## Set-Reset (SR) Latch
- Basic flip-flop circuit where:
    - **Set (S)**: \( Q \rightarrow 1 \) when \( S = 1 \), \( R = 0 \).
    - **Reset (R)**: \( Q \rightarrow 0 \) when \( R = 1 \), \( S = 0 \).
- **Invalid State**: \( S = R = 1 \) causes undefined behavior.
- To ensure correct operation, introduce control signals that maintain timing constraints.

### Set-Reset Latch Characteristic Table:
| S  | R  | Q (Next State) |
|----|----|----------------|
| 0  | 0  | No change       |
| 0  | 1  | Reset (0)       |
| 1  | 0  | Set (1)         |
| 1  | 1  | Invalid         |

### Timing Considerations:
- **Minimum Input Duration**: 
    - \( S \) or \( R \) must remain stable for at least \( 2\Delta t \) for proper operation.
- Clock control: A clock signal is introduced to synchronize input changes.

## Clocked J-K Flip-Flop
- **Deterministic behavior** when \( J = K = 1 \), causing the flip-flop to toggle between states.
- Requires a clock pulse of **precisely 2\(\Delta t\) to 3\(\Delta t\)** for proper operation.

### Pulse Shaper Circuit
- Generates clock pulses of specific durations, independent of the input clock signal length.
- Ensures flip-flop is **edge-triggered**, meaning state changes occur on clock signal transitions.

## Master-Slave J-K Flip-Flop
- **Reliable Sequential Circuit**:
    - Master flip-flop operates when clock is high, and slave operates when clock is low.
    - This prevents the simultaneous change of states and avoids errors due to input fluctuations during transitions.
    - The circuit requires a full clock cycle (rising and falling edges) for state changes to propagate.

## D-Latch (Level-Triggered)
- **Single Input Flip-Flop**:
    - Input D is stored when the enable signal \( G = 1 \).
    - Output \( Q \) follows \( D \) as long as \( G = 1 \), but freezes when \( G = 0 \).
    - The D-Latch is often used in memory and storage applications.

### D-Latch Characteristic Table:
| D  | G  | Q (Next State) |
|----|----|----------------|
| 0  | 1  | 0              |
| 1  | 1  | 1              |
| X  | 0  | No change      |

## State and *Excitation* Tables
- **State Tables**: Describe the behavior of flip-flops based on current input and state.
- **Excitation Tables**: Provide required input values to transition a flip-flop from its current state to the desired next state.

### Example for J-K Flip-Flop:
State transitions for a J-K Flip-Flop can be summarized in a truth table, with characteristic equations derived using K-Maps.

$$
Q_{n+1} = J \overline{Q_n} + \overline{K} Q_n
$$

## Timing and Clock Considerations
- Flip-flops require precise clock signals for reliable operation.
- Master-Slave flip-flops are more robust against clock edge timing issues, making them useful in complex digital systems where synchronization is critical.
