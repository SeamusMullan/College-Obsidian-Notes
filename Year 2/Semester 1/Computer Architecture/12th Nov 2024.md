## Designing circuits from words

Take expected outcomes
Define states for the outputs (that change after clock pulses)
Define what state is next using a table

before drawing K-maps, we need to capture the transition types occuring between the two flip flops.

Symbols used to represent 0 -> 1 = i, 1 -> 0 = phi, then 1->1 and 0->0 are 1 and 0 respectively

*a lot of yap later*

i might be cooked
