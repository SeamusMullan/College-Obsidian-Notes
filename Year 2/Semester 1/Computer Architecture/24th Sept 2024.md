## Digital Logic Circuits

## Transistors

Transistors function like switches, with 3 terminals (source, gate, drain) where the gate controls current passing between the source and drain.

i.e.
5V on source
$n$ V on gate, where $n>0$
5V at drain

### Creating Logic Gates / Boolean Algebra

By combining transistors in __

Boolean terms:
Unary $\to$ single input and output

### Creating Circuits with Logic Gates

Combining logic gates allows us to create circuits that
