## Better Addition (and subtraction)

With the last lecture, we daisy-chained 1 bit adders to make an n bit adder. the problem with this was that the carry was required to be sent to the next adder, adding a gate delay for every bit

Today we are going to cover a carry lookahead adder along with other more complex components i.e. Buffers, Tri-State Buffers ,Multiplexers


## Adder / Subtractor

This is our current design for an adder, currently if we try scaling this we end up getting an increasing delay which becomes unacceptably large.

To fix this, we can simultaneously calculate all the carry bits, using boolean algebraic logic i.e. we can express any function as 2 layers of sum of products.

We use 2 functions **Generate** & **Propagate** where
$$\begin{matrix}
G_{i} = A_{i} . B_{i} \\
P_{i} = A_{i} + B_{i}
\end{matrix}$$
$G_{i}$ will definitely be generated if either $A_{i} \text{ or } B_{i}$ equal $0$
$P_{i}$ might be generated when the function is combined with c-out$_{i-1}$

**uhh i zoned out and now we might be cooked**

## Circuit Interfacing

4 common circuits used in logic design for interfacing components

### Multiplexer & Demultiplexer

Multiplexers are used for data transmission and allow you to share a communication path between two paths. We can control what circuit parts are connected and can link multiple 

### Decoder & Encoder

Used for translating binary numbers to spacial locations. i.e. addresses of devices we want to enable. Encoders do the opposite i.e. it only lets one speak at once.

basically, decoder shuts the rest up, encoder lets one speak when it asks

## Data Transmission

bits are transmitted serially in time along a wire, if we want to transmit more than one bit at a time, we need more wires

We send data at a specified frequency, so that we can send data quick enough that its sampled correctly, but not too quickly/slowly so that it gets misinterpreted.

# ALL MY HOMIES HATE COPPER WIRE

this was an aside, but yeah light is fast, use fibre wires


## Multiplexers are just a bit representation of what signal gets through, boom done


## Tri-State Buffer

buffers are used between two circuits to convert representation of binary numbers between components, i.e. low and high voltage components. This is similar to a relay in which a low voltage toggle can switch high voltages.

Tri state buffers have a 3rd state in which we consider output disconnected, i.e. there is no electrical effect. This is not like connecting something to ground (since that allows current to flow to it) but it is more like the wire not existing.

## Decoders

With $n$ inputs we can generate $2^n$ outputs with which we can use to select / enable parts of our computer.
