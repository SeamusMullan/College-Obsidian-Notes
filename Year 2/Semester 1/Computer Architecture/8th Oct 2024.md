## Converting sum of products to NAND only form

This means we convert a *bunch* of gates into just NAND gates cuz its \*faster\*

We can only do this provided we have **no limit** on the number of inputs and that our expression is only expressed in 2 levels of gates (two-level sum of products)

A two level sum of products results in the *Shortest Critical Path* and therefore the fastest circuit (less wires, less time wasted ig)

This whole thing lies on the following boolean maths
$$A+B = not(\bar{A}.\bar{B})$$


## Representing Numbers Systems in binary

### Decimal numbers
Decimal numbers use 10 symbols, 0 through 9 with *positional notation*

The base / radix of a number system represents the number of different symbols used to represent number, i.e. binary -> 2, hex -> 16

Positional notation makes arithmetic easier, as opposed to other notation eg roman numerals

### Binary Numbers
**N.B.** Binary uses 1 and 0 where position represents $2^n$

### Binary Fractions
We can just use a point between binary numbers, like this

11.011 = 3.375
11 -> 3
$011 \to 0\times2^{-1} + 1\times2^{-2} +1\times2^{-3}$

#### Converting Decimal fractions to binary

basically just split into whole numbers and decimal part (ie the less than 1 part) and then just subtract negative powers of 2 until we get to 0, then represent that as binary + add back the dot.


### Representing Negative Numbers

### Unsigned Integers
These are numbers represented in binary where there is just a magnitude, ie a number or 0

The n number of bits can represent numbers in the range $0 \to 2^{n}-1$, ie for an 8 bit unsigned int ranges 0 -> 255

### Signed Integers
The sign of the number is encoded in the bits of these numbers, denoted a **sign bit**, this results in a identical number of integers albeit shifted about 0, resulting in an 8 bit signed int representing -128 to +127

the number n bits can represent a number from $-2^{n-1} \to 2^{n-1}-1$

Basically this means we have the same amount of numbers, just a different range for them including negative numbers.

Note: the sign bit is treated differently by the hardware

### Aside
#rant
We can use the 10s compliment of a number to subtract it from another number without having to use signed integers / numbers. If you ask me its some top tier bullshit since we have the technology to be a little bit inefficient on a silicon die. A bigger problem would probably arise from the way that the circuits are implemented on the silicon as opposed to the processes they use to calculate numbers. This probably requires a translation layer for the signed numbers to be changes or uses more die space to process more info but at the end of the day, it works no?

### Floating Point Numbers
uhhh

## Arithmetic Operations (in binary)

### Addition & Subtraction

#### For Addition
$$
\begin{matrix}
0 + 0 = 0 \\
0 + 1 = 1\\
1 + 0 = 1\\
1 + 1 = 0 \text{ w/ carry, i.e. 10}
\end{matrix}
$$
Note where we add 2 positive single bits, we get a double bit output
#### For Subtraction

$$
\begin{matrix}
\text{ note subtraction represents difference}\\
0 - 0 = 0 \\
0 - 1 = 1\\
1 - 1 = 0\\
0 - 1 = 0 \text{ difference of 1 w/ borrow of 1}
\end{matrix}
$$


### Multiplication & Division

$$
\begin{matrix}
\text{Multiplication <-> Product} \\
0 \times 0 = 0 \\
0 \times 1 = 0\\
1 \times 0 = 0\\
1 \times 1 = 1
\end{matrix}
$$

Manually multiplying -> multiply each digit in bottom row by entire top row and add

Note: Multiplication may require doubling the number of bits of the operand

$$
\begin{matrix}
\text{Division} \\
0 \div 0 = NaN \\
0 \div 1 = 0 \text{ Quotient}\\
1 \div 0 = NaN \\
1 \div 1 = 0 \text{ Quotient}
\end{matrix}
$$

Division is basically "trial subtraction" to see if we can take our original number away again. if we cant we get a remainder, i.e.

10 / 3 ->
10 - 3 = 7
7 - 3 = 4
4 - 3 = 1
1 - 3 -> negative number!

divided 3 times
remainder = 1



#### Hexadecimal

just go do an arts degree tbh


but fr just split it into groups of 4 and make em hex numbers (0 -> 9 then A -> F)

Binary and schematics type shit

Techniques and blueprints fr

Straight engineering and combobulating fr fr



I reckon im a qualified ocean gate engineer

I reckon im a qualified cloudstrike engineer


## ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)

Thingy in a CPU that adds and does logic :)
Sum = XOR gate :) (this will absolutely not help me study)
