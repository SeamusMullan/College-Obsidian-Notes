## EP Fault Model

The equivalence partition fault model is where entire ranges of values arent processed correctly, which can bas associated with incorrect decisions in code along with other things.

Strengths:
- basic level
- easily identified
- distinct
- easy partitioning
- structured
Weakesses
- No testing of correct processing on partition edges
- no **combination** testing

### Week 3 Test

Prep:
- asking abt aspects of labs
- important things, practice
- implementation w/TestNG
- 7 steps for sw testing activities

## Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)

Black box testing is a combination of Equivalence Partitioning and Boundary Value Analysis

**Boundary Values:** are values at the edges / crossovers of equivalence partitions.

Fault model of BVA:
where values on edge of EP ranges are identified incorrectly, which leads to incorrect processing.

This could find dev errors. i.e. *less than* & *less than or equals* (< vs <=)
