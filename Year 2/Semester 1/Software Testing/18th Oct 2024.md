## Decision Table Testing

*This affects the Analysis portion of the SW testing activities*

Using decision tables we can create a list of inputs and outputs (Causes and Effects). We can call these combinations of causes and effects ***rules***.

This information can be represented as a truth table (in boolean values) that can be used to find a minimum subset of all the possible combinations of causes and effects.

**Using the old example:**

A good starting point is the EP partitions.

We can move from a range of points combined with the GOLDCUSTOMER value being in a range to being either true or false for goldcustomer

We can then defined effects of either FULLPRICE and discount (we can discount the error partition)

### Identifying all the combinations

Ideally we have a table with all our causes and the combinations of outputs they provide. We can use a truth table to quickly make this, but we need to find how many combinations we need.

A simple rule is that for $N$ causes, we need $2^N$ combinations.

### Creating the precursor to truth table
*Note: Order is important*

**Causes:**
- goldCustomer == true
- 

**Effects:**
- FULLPRICE
- DISCOUNT

Causes (Left Column)
Combinations (all other values)

|                    |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BonusPoints <= 80  | T   | T   | T   | T   | F   | F   | F   | F   |
| BonusPoints <= 120 | T   | T   | F   | F   | T   | T   | F   | F   |
| goldCustomer       | T   | F   | T   | F   | T   | F   | T   | F   |

Note Column 3 and 4 are contradictions, i.e. we cant be less than 80, but not less than 120. This means we can remove these combinations from the tables (since they cant happen)

### Actually making the truth table

Now we can generate the final truth table that we can use to make tests from.

*x represents a contradiction column which we can remove*

| Causes             |     |     | x   | x   |     |     |     |     |
| ------------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BonusPoints <= 80  | T   | T   | T   | T   | F   | F   | F   | F   |
| BonusPoints <= 120 | T   | T   | F   | F   | T   | T   | F   | F   |
| goldCustomer       | T   | F   | T   | F   | T   | F   | T   | F   |
| **Effects**        |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| FULLPRICE          | T   | T   | x   | x   | T   | T   | F   | F   |
| DISCOUNT           | F   | F   | x   | x   | F   | F   | T   | T   |

The final table shown below

| Causes             |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BonusPoints <= 80  | T   | T   | F   | F   | F   | F   |
| BonusPoints <= 120 | T   | T   | T   | T   | F   | F   |
| goldCustomer       | T   | F   | T   | F   | T   | F   |
| **Effects**        |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| FULLPRICE          | T   | T   | T   | T   | F   | F   |
| DISCOUNT           | F   | F   | F   | F   | T   | T   |
