## Independent Events

Two events are independent if 
$$P(A\cap B) = P(A)P(B)$$

which can also be written
$$A \perp B$$

### Example 1:

A = card is ace
B = card is diamond

Does one outcome affect the chance of another?
$$\begin{matrix}
P(A) = \frac{1}{13} \\
P(B) = \frac{1}{4} \\
P(A\cap B) = \text{Ace of Diamonds} = \frac{1}{52} \\ \\

\text{To check for independence, multiply and check if equal to intersection probability} \\
 \\
\frac{1}{13} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{52} = P(A\cap B) \\
\therefore \text{A and B are Independent}
\end{matrix}$$

Noting from above, it doesn't matter if the card we pick is an ace or a diamond, it doesn't affect the chance of the other event occurring, i.e. if we pick an ace, the chance of it being a diamond is still the same (and vice versa)

### Example 2:

We have a box containing 3 red and 2 black balls. two are drawn **without replacement**.

A = 1st ball is red
B = 2nd ball is red

Are A and B independent?

first, lets pretend the balls are numbered, 1-3 are red and 4-5 are black.
$$\begin{matrix}
Red=\{1,2,3\} \\
Black = \{4,5\} \\
\text{We know from previous lectures that the total number of outcomes} \\
\text{is equal to } 5\times 4 \text{ since this is a permutation}
\end{matrix}$$
i.e.
$$\frac{5!}{(5-2)!} = \frac{5\times 4 \times 3!}{3!} = 20$$

We can now find that the scenarios where we pick 1, 2 or 3 first (red) is 
$$\begin{matrix}
A = \{\text{All pairs starting with 1, 2 or 3}\} = \frac{12}{20} = 0.6 \\
B = \{\text{All pairs ending with 1, 2 or 3}\} = \frac{12}{20} = 0.6 \\
P(A\cap B) = \{\text{All pairs starting OR ending with 1, 2 or 3}\} \\
P(A \cap B) = \frac{6}{20} = \frac{3}{10} = 0.3 \\
 \\
\text{Now to check if independent, we multiply A and B} \\
0.6 \times 0.6 = 0.36 \neq 0.3 \\
\therefore \text{A and B are not independent}
\end{matrix}$$
This shows that the outcome of the first event (picking a red) affects the second event (namely because we aren't replacing the balls)

### Example 3:

Take the above example but **replace the balls** after we pick them. We now know there are 5x5 equally likely ordered outcomes.

$$\begin{matrix}
A = \{11, 12, 13, \dots 53, 54, 55\} \\
B = \{11, 21, 31 \dots 23, 33, 43, 53\} \\ \\
P(A \cap B) = \{11, 12,13, 21, 22, 23, 31, 32, 33\} \\ \\
P(A) = 0.6 \\
P(B) = 0.6 \\
P(A \cap B) = 0.36 = P(A)P(B) \\
\therefore \text{A and B are independent}

\end{matrix}$$

Take note that the face we replaced the ball affects the independence of the outcomes.

## Conditional Probability

Base theorem, ie


Given two events A and B, the conditional probability of A given B is defined as

This represents the probability of A when B has already happened, referencing the example above, the chance of 
$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$$
Also Note:
$$\begin{matrix}
P(A\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B) =P(B|A)P(A)
\end{matrix}$$
P(A|B) is basically the area of a venn diagram where A exists in P(B), ie

### Example 1:

Take the example of these students

|          | Male | Female |
| -------- | ---- | ------ |
| Arts     | 30%  | 30%    |
| Not Arts | 25%  | 15%    |
F = event student is female
A = event student studies arts

P(F|A) represents the following:
**Given that** the student selected studies arts (A), what is the chance they are female

$$\begin{matrix}
P(F) = 0.55 \\
P(A) = 0.6 \\
P(F\cap A) = 0.3 \\
P(F|A) = \frac{P(F\cap A)}{P(A)} = \frac{0.3}{0.6} = 0.5 \text{ or } 50\%
\end{matrix}$$

Note! $$P(F|A) \neq P(A|F)$$
### Probability Tree Diagram

Using the example above, we can make a tree diagram like the following. Note that what we want to condition on comes first.
