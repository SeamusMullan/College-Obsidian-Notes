# Estimation & Confidence intervals for Small samples

For a small sample size, we assume
$$
\frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{s / \sqrt{ n }} \textasciitilde t_{(n-1)}
$$

Student's t distribution, the t distribution allows for more outliers / has heavier tails. $t_{(n-1)}$ denotes the t-distribution with $\nu=n-1$ degrees of freedom. (note the letter $\nu$ \[nu\], not $v$)

The tails get heavier as our degrees of freedom decrease, that is that the fewer samples we have, the heavier the tails of our t distribution will be. As the number of samples approaches 30 we get close to the normal distribution.

Instead of using $Z$ we now use the interval $$\bar{X} \pm t_{\left( \nu, \frac{\alpha}{2} \right)}\frac{s}{\sqrt{ n }}$$
##### *Note: when doing this we **assume** the true population is normal.*

Critical values for the student's t tables are tabulated, namely where sample size < 30
