## Continuous Random Variables

**Note: No Integrals will be on exam**

Starting with examples
- Length of a caterpillar (or anything really)
- Distances
- Weights

CRVs exist on the real line i.e. $(-\infty, \infty), (0,\infty), (5, 25)$

### Probability Density Function and CDF of a CRV

$$\begin{matrix}
f(x)\geq 0 \\
\text{ f(x) not required to be less than 1} \\
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x) dx = 1 \\
P(a \leq X \leq b ) = \int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx \\
\end{matrix}$$

Probabilities are now measured in intervals, i.e. the area under the curve between two points $a$ and $b$. $f(x)$ does **not** represent the probability of an event where $X=x$
$$\begin{matrix}
f(x) \neq P(X=x) \\
P(X=a) = \int_{a}^{a}f(x) dx = 0
\end{matrix}$$


### Cumulative Distribution Function

for an example 

$$\begin{matrix}
P(x\leq 1) = F(1) \\
\text{Graphically this represents the area between 0 and 1 under the function f(x)}
\end{matrix}$$
This makes converting a PDF to a CDF easy since we can:

1. Convert a PDF to a CDF by taking the integral of the PDF
	1. $F(x) = \int f(x)$
2. Convert a CDF to a PDF by differentiating the existing CDF
	1. $f(x) (+c) = F(x) \frac{d}{dx}$
