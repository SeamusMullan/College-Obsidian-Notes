## Mutually Exclusive / Disjoint Events

$$\begin{matrix}
\text{ Take two events A and B, they are mutually exclusive if} \\
A \cap B = \emptyset
\end{matrix}$$
**Examples:**
- Walking in a specific direction (i.e. you cant walk left AND right at the same time)
- Taking a car or a bus to college
- Doing any event $A$ that you can't do while doing $B$

**Question:** Does this make $A$ and $B$ independent?
**Answer:** It does not!

## Partitions

A partition is a collection of mutually exclusive events whose union is $\ohm$. Any set or event can be partitioned.

### Example 1:
Take a sample space $\ohm$. We can split it into partitions $B_{1}, B_{2} \dots B_{n}$ and say that all these mutually exclusive events union back into $\ohm$.

We could have other events like $A, B, \dots$ that contain multiple subsets of these partitions, and when we sub all the subsets up we get the probability of that event

This can be written as follows for any event $A$ where $k$ is any number of subsets.

$$
P(A) = \sum^k_{i=1} P(A \cap B_{i})
$$

Logically we can also say that any sample space $\ohm$ is the summation of any of the events in the sample space, as well as the difference between the events and the subsets of the partitions.



## Example Question

13% of respondents had children and a large car
12% of respondents had no children and had a large car

**Find the probability of selecting a respondent that has a large car**

we can break down this problem into to events
$$\begin{matrix}
A \to \text{Children} \\
B \to \text{Large car}
\end{matrix}$$
Since we know the number of of respondents who had a large car, regardless of having children we can say the following
$$
\begin{matrix}
P(A\cap B) = 0.13 \\
P(A^{c}\cap B)= 0.12 \\
13\%+12\%=25\% \text{ of people have a large car} \\
\therefore P(B) = 0.25
\end{matrix}
$$

This is simple enough since we can just add the probabilities to find out what the chance of picking a person with a large car is.

## Bayes Theorem
This is it
$$\begin{matrix}
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)} \\
\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B \cap A)}{P(A)} \\
=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \\
=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B|A)P(A)+P(B|A^c)P(A^c)} \\
\end{matrix}$$
basically express $P(A|B)$ using $P(B|A)$ and $P(B|A^c)$

i.e. the chance of A given B is the same as

The chance of B given A times chance of A
OVER
Chance of B given A times chance of A + Chance of B given not A times P not A
