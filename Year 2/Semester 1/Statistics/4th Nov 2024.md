# Special Continuous Distributions

## The exponential distribution

Mainly used to measure the time *until* an event happens (look at survival analysis)
- i.e. lifetime of components
- time between earthquakes

$$\begin{matrix}
\text{Exponential Distributuon} \\
\text{let Y be a number of earthquakes in a year and assume that we can model Y with a Poisson distribution, i.e.} \\
Y \sim Poisson(\lambda)
\end{matrix}$$

### Example 1:

Let X = time between people at till at supermarket. model this as X ~exp($\lambda = 2$)
***
$P(X\leq 1) = F(1)$

The CDF for exp distribution = $1-e^{-\lambda x}$
$P(X\leq 1) = 1 - e^{-2} = 0.86$

**If we replaced $\leq$ with $<$, no change occurs since $P(X=a)=0$ for continuous distributions**
***
$P(1 \leq X \leq 2) = F(2) - F(1)$

***
$$\begin{matrix}
P(X>3) = 1-P(X<3) = F(3)\\
F(3)=e^{-2(3)}=e^{-6}=0.002478752177
\end{matrix}$$
***
Mean time between arrivals

Mean = $\frac{1}{\lambda}$ = $\frac{1}{2}$

i.e. the mean time between arrivals is 30 seconds.
***

### Example 2:

Suppose length of a phone call is exp random variable with $\lambda = \frac{1}{10}$

Random variable -> length, let X be the length in minutes

$P(X > 10) = 1 - P(X<10) = 1-F(10)$
$F(10) = e^{-10 \times\frac{1}{10}} = e^{-1}= 0.368$ 
***
$P(10<X<20) = F(20)-F(10)= e^{-20}{10} + e^{-1} =0.2325441579$
***
## The Normal Distribution

**The most commonly used distribution in stats**

- Experimental errors in scientific measurements
- test scores in aptitude tests
- heights of people selected at random from a population

nb, we dont *need* to use the big ol formula, we can use the tables in the ***tables*** book instead

mu -> location
sigma -> wideness

E(X) = mu
Var(X) = sigma^2
SD(X) = sigma

#### Properties of the normal distribution

- *bell* shaped
- Symmetric about $\mu$
- Follows 68:95:99.7 rule. i.e.
	
	% Within Num SDs
	1 SDs -> 68
	2 SDs -> 95
	3 SDs -> 99.7
$$\begin{matrix}
68\% \text{ in } (\mu - \sigma, \mu + \sigma) \\
95\% \text{ in } (\mu - 2\sigma, \mu + 2\sigma) \\
99.7\% \text{ in } (\mu - 3\sigma, \mu + 3\sigma)
\end{matrix}$$

## Standard Normal Distribution

If X is normal, the Standard Normal is called Z, ie ~N(0, 1)
$$\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma} = Z$$
Note, the values for these probabilities must be obtained from a table.

Departmental Statistical Tables are the tables we use for this. We **WILL** get one in the final exam.
