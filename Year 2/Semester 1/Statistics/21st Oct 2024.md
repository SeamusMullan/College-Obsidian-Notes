## Bernoulli + Binomial Distribution / trials

Bernoulli is superset of binomial, with only 0 or 1
binomial is a sum of Bernoulli

with n bernoulli trials, the max identical outcomes is = n


## Poisson Distribution

Count Data distribution, you can count 0 -> infty
We measure **rates**, i.e. number of x per unit y
#### Examples
- Number of plankton cells per litre of water
- Number of earthquakes per year
- N of $x$ per / in $y$

PMF:
$$P(X = x) = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^x}{x!}$$

NB for poisson mean = variance aka equi-dispersion
$$\begin{matrix}
E[X]=\lambda \\
Var(X)=\lambda
\end{matrix}$$

In nature its unlikely this holds and under / over dispersion tends to happen, in which other distributions work better.


### The PMF (again)

With the pmf we know that $x \in \{0,1,2,3,\dots\infty\}$

If we take the limit of the binomial with the knowledge that our variance and expected value are equal we arrive at the pmf for the poisson distrubution.

### Using the thingy


### Example 1.1:

Num of calls per hour is random with mean 3, say X ~ poisson($\lambda=3$)

$$\begin{matrix}
P(X=0) = \frac{e^{-3}3^{0}}{0!} = 0.0498 \\
P(X=0) = \frac{e^{-3}3^{0}}{1!} = 0.1494 \\
\text{ contd}\dots
\end{matrix}$$
### Example 1.2:

What is probability of getting **no calls** in **two hour** period

i.e. $P(X=0) \text{, where }\lambda \text{ = 6 since } 3\times2=6$
Do same as above..

### Example 2:

6.7 patients per hour in a doctors office. follow poisson distribution.

probability of at most 3 patients ->

$$\begin{matrix}
x \to Poisson(\lambda=6.7) \\
P(X\leq 3) = P(X=0) + P(X=1) + P(X=2) + P(X=3) \\
\text{ do similar to ex 1.1, just use the fuckin calculator} \\
P(X\leq 3) = 0.0988
\end{matrix}$$
probability pf exactly 5 people in next 90 minutes
90 min -> 1.5 hr

$$\begin{matrix}
\lambda = 6.7 * 1.5 \\
x\to Poisson(\lambda=10.05) \\
P(X=5) = \frac{e^{-10.05}10.05^{5}}{5!} = 0.036896\dots
\end{matrix}$$

### Exercise 3 (he likes this one!, might be in exam):

1. Suppose occurrence of no earthquakes follows poisson with rate 7 per year


$$\begin{matrix}
x \to Poisson(\lambda=7) \\
\text{1. what is P(X=0)} \\
thing \\
\text{2. }
\end{matrix}$$

2. Probability no earthquakes in one year

NB max number is 8 now, 
Let y = num of years / 8 without earthquakes
sum of independent bernoullis, i.e. binomial

$P(y=1) =$
