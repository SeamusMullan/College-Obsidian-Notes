# Covariance between two discrete random variables

$$
\begin{matrix}
\text{The covariance can be any real value.} \\
Cov(X,Y)=E[XY]-E[X]E[Y]
\end{matrix}
$$
We can also get the $Cov(X,X)$ which is equal to $Var(X)$

$$\begin{matrix}
E[X] = \sum\limits_{x}P(X=x) \\
E[y] = \sum\limits_{y}P(Y=y) \\
E[XY] = \sum\limits_{x}\sum\limits_{y} xy P(X=x, Y=y)
\end{matrix}$$

Think of $E[XY]$ like multiplying the coords by the value for every value in the table

i.e. something in the top left with X,Y = -1, -1 and a value 2/8 would be written
$(-1)(-1)\left( \frac{2}{8} \right)$

Correlation coeffecient is

$$\begin{matrix}
\rho xy=\frac{Cov(X,Y)}{\sqrt{ Var(X)Var(Y) }} \\
\text{We can show -1 < ρxy < 1}
\end{matrix}$$

If X and Y are independent then Cov(X,Y) = 0 however a covariance of 0 does not indicate independence, i.e.

If X, Y are independent -> Cov(X,Y) must = 0

Cov(X,Y) = 0, does not mean X and Y are independent

furthermore:

X and Y are independent if:
$P(X=x, Y=y) = P(X=x)P(Y=y)$

i.e. X and Y are independent if the joint probability is equal to the product of the marginal probabilities
