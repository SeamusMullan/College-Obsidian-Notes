## Sampling Problems

### Sampling

**Types**
- Ordered / unordered
- with / without replacement

### Sampling without replacement

Assume a box with 5 tickets numbered 1 to 5. Take two tickets, not replacing them in the box, the number of possibilites is as follows

We have 20 outcomes that are all equally likely, note that 1 then 2 is different to 2 then 1, i.e. the order matters, making these **Ordered samples without replacement**

Assuming this problem grows past 5 tickets, we cant list out all the numbers so what we can do is the following


If we are taking two tickets, we start with 5 options for the first, followed by 5-1 for the second.

We can call this a **Permutation**, i.e. an ordered outcome
A **Combination** would be where the order doesnt matter (getting 3 and 4, regardless of order)
#### Combinations, Permutations, all this bs

For Combinations, we use N choose K
The button on a calculator is $nCr$
$$\binom{N}{K} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$
For Permutations
The button on a calculator is $nPr$
$$\binom{N}{K} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$

We know that permutations are always larger since there are $k!$ ways we can scramble up our values in any order.

### Sampling with replacement

In this scenario with the same example, we just put the ticket back in the box before we pick another one out again, making our outcome list look like this

This means that every time we draw we have the same amount of options, i.e. the first draw could be 5 numbers, the second draw could also be 5 numbers

This means we can just write the total number of probabilites as $5^2$

The probability of a 3 followed by 4 in this scenario is now $\frac{1}{25}$ since we have more total outcomes
The probability of a 3 and 4 in any order is $\frac{2}{15}$

Note: this means that the outcomes are no longer equally likely, ie theres only one way to get a pair of 1s but there are 2 ways to get a 1 and 2 in any order.

### Perms and Coms xd

with replacement, equally likely outcomes out of $n^k$

without replacement we have non equal outcomes
$$\binom{n+k-1}{k}$$

### Problem 1

Suppose we have a box has 100 chips, 90 are normal and 10 are defective. if 4 chips are selected randomly:
- What is the chance the sample has no defects
- whats the probability there are exactly 2 defects

Observation: Unordered, No replacement

**Part 1:**

P(no defects) = # choices of 4 / 90 / # total unordered

= $$= \binom{90}{4} / \binom{100}{4}$$

**Part 2:**
