## Probability Functions


Example 1: suppose a student population broken down into the table below

|          | female | male |
| -------- | ------ | ---- |
| arts     | 30%    | 30%  |
| not arts | 25%    | 15%  |

One student is randomly selected
F = event selected is student
A = event selected student studies arts

Solve the following

1. $P(F)$
2. $P(F^c )$
3. $P(A)$
4. $P(A^c )$
5. $P(F ∩ A)$
6. $P(F^c ∩ A)$
7. $P(F ∪ A)$

We can add extra total values to the table to represent different categories, i.e.

|          | female | male | total (not) in arts |
| -------- | ------ | ---- | ------------------- |
| arts     | 30%    | 30%  | 60%                 |
| not arts | 25%    | 15%  | 40%                 |
| total    | 55%    | 45%  |                     |

### Axioms of probability
1. For any event $A, 0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1$
2.
$$P(A) = \sum_{a \in A} P(a)$$
3.
$$P(\Omega) = \sum_{a \in \Omega} P(a) = 1$$


### Probability of complement

$$P(A^{c}) = P(\Omega) $$
