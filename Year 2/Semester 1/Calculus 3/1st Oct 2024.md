## Euclidian space of $\mathbb{R}^n$

Standard unit vectors represented as
$$
e_{i} = (0, 0, 0, \dots 1, 0, 0, \dots)
$$
where a 1 is placed in.the $i^{th}$ position

**Note: in $\mathbb{R}^3$ we represent the unit vectors $e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3}$ as $i, j, k$**


### Orthogonal Projection

Projection of u onto v defined above

Let $$\lambda \frac{u \cdot v}{||v||^{2}}\in \mathbb{R}$$some bullshit occurs
$$\lambda \frac{u \cdot v}{||v||^{2}} \times ||v||^2$$
***

Assume we have a vector U and V, we can write U as $$(u - proj_v(U)) - proj_v(U)$$ where the first term is orthogonal to V $$(u - proj_v(U))$$ and the second term is parallel to V
$$
proj_{v(U)}
$$

### Cross Product on $\mathbb{R}^3$
