## Arrays :\(

yeah shit shot boring bro im ngl

arrays are big ol chunks of memory we chop up gordon ramsay style. every chunk is equal and is the size of the data type we be storing

ie:
assuming an int
dataTypeSize can be many variables depending on the kind of int (32, 64, long, etc)

| Address | 0   | 1   | ... | arrayLen\*dataTypeSize |
| ------- | --- | --- | --- | ---------------------- |
| Data    | 12  | 23  | 52  | 55                     |
shits fast, shits simple, we can get shit in o(1) time or smth idk

FUCK ARRAYS, ALL MY HOMIES HATE ARRAYS
