## Database Management System (DBMS)

Data Definition Language (DDL)
- Allows all users to specify data types, structures and constraints for data stored in db
Data Manipulation Language (DML)
- i.e. SQL


**End users**
- Using a UI or other means to edit and manage data
- unaware of DBMS
**Sophisticated users**
- Aware of DBMS
- use DMLs like SQL to manipulate data

### Three Level Architecture

- External
	- User Views (relevant to each user)
- Conceptual
	- Conceptual Schema (describes data stored + relations)
- Internal
	- Internal Schema (physical Representation of the database, structures, records, etc.)
- Physical Data Organisation
	- Combination of Internal and conceptual level on a disk / drive


### Recovery Services

Think multiple users editing data, financial things. Someone takes money out while another is reading a balance, time writing data wrong and oops you got infinite money :3

### Entity-Relationship (E-R) Diagrams
- **Entities** (like `STUDENT`, `MODULE`, `LECTURER`) contain **attributes** (e.g., `Studentnumber`, `Name`, `ModuleNumber`, etc.).
- **Relationships** between entities can have different forms: 
  - 1:1 (one-to-one)
  - 1:N (one-to-many)
  - M:N (many-to-many)
- **Membership classes** in relationships can be **optional** or **compulsory**.

---

### Data Types in Databases:
Some common SQL data types include:
- **INTEGER**: Signed integer, optional size limit, e.g., `INTEGER(4)`
- **DECIMAL**: For fractional numbers, e.g., `DECIMAL(4,3)` specifies overall digits and digits after the decimal point.
- **CHAR**: Fixed-size character string, e.g., `CHAR(30)`
- **VARCHAR**: Variable size character string, e.g., `VARCHAR(30)`
- **DATE**: Calendar date
- **TIME**: 24-hour clock
- **TIMESTAMP**: Stores both date and time.

---

### Relational Schema:
- **Tables** can be derived from E-R diagrams, where entities and their relationships translate into tables.
- E.g., `STUDENT(Studentnumber, Name, Address, ...)`, `MODULE(ModuleNumber, Title, Maxsize, ...)`, `LECTURER(Lecturername, Department, ...)`, and `TAKE(Studentnumber, ModuleNumber, Mark)`.

---

### Structured Query Language (SQL):
1. **Origins**: Developed by IBM in the 1970s, standardized by ANSI in 1986.
2. **SQL is Declarative**: You specify *what* you want to retrieve, not *how* to do it (unlike procedural programming).
3. **Basic Operations**:
   - **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: Used to create and modify tables and schema (e.g., `CREATE`, `DROP`, `ALTER`).
   - **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: Used to manipulate data in tables (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).

---

### PostgreSQL:
- An advanced open-source database, comparable to Oracle.
- PostgreSQL supports all standard SQL queries and will be used for lab exercises in this course.

---

### Creating Tables in SQL:
- **Syntax**: 
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE <table name> (<column name> <data type> [(<size>)] <column constraint>, ... <keys>);
  ```

  Example:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Student (
    studentID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    studentName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    studentAddress VARCHAR(300),
    studentYOB INTEGER
  );
  ```

- **Column Constraints**: 
  - **UNIQUE**: Ensures no duplicate values.
  - **NOT NULL**: Prevents null values in the column.
  - **PRIMARY KEY**: Identifies a unique key for the table.
  - **REFERENCES**: Defines a foreign key relationship to another table.

---

### SQL SELECT Queries:
- **Basic Query**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column_name FROM table_name;
  ```
  Example:
  ```sql
  SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Persons;
  ```

- **SELECT all columns**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Persons;
  ```

- **Filtering with WHERE clause**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition;
  ```
  Example:
  ```sql
  SELECT Student_No, Student_Name FROM STUDENT WHERE year = 2;
  ```

---

### SQL Important Features:
- **Quoting Strings**: Enclose string values in single quotes.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Student WHERE studentname = 'William';
  ```

- **Wildcard** (`*`): Selects all columns from a table.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Student WHERE studentid = 88873;
  ```

---

### Important Information:
- **Understand the difference** between declarative and procedural programming in SQL.
- **Familiarize yourself** with SQL data types and how they translate to real-world data storage.
- **Master SQL queries**: Especially the SELECT statement, filtering with WHERE, and joining tables.
- **Practice** with PostgreSQL as it will be the main database for the course.

# Understanding M:N / M:M vs M:1 in ERDs

Reference ERD:
![[Pasted image 20241003113708.png]]

### 1. M and N in ERDs:
- **M** and **N** often represent **"many"** and are ***interchangeable*** in general.
- Both **M** and **N** indicate that an entity can have many relationships with another entity. For example:
  - **M:N** or **N:M** = many-to-many relationship.
  - Example: Many **students** can take many **modules**.

### 2. Optional vs Mandatory Relationships:
- **M (or N)**: Typically means **"0 or more"**, indicating an **optional** relationship.
- **1**: Means **"1 or more"**, indicating a **mandatory** relationship.

#### Examples:
- **M:N (Many-to-Many)**:
  - Each side can relate to **0, 1, or many** instances of the other.
  - Example: Many **students** can take many **modules**.
  
- **M:1 (Many-to-One)**:
  - One side (**M**) can relate to **0 or more** instances (optional), while the other side (**1**) must relate to **at least one** instance (mandatory).
  - Example: 
    - A **lecturer** can teach **0 or more** modules (**optional**).
    - A **module** must be taught by **at least one lecturer** (**mandatory**).

### 3. Visual Representation in ERD:
- **M (or N): 0 or more** is often shown with a **crow’s foot and a circle** (⊗) near the entity, meaning the relationship is **optional**.
- **1: 1 or more** is represented with a **crow’s foot or line** without a circle, meaning the relationship is **mandatory**.

### 4. Real-World Example:
In an ERD with **Modules** and **Lecturers**:
- **N:1** (many-to-one):
  - **Many modules** must have **at least one lecturer** (mandatory for the module).
  - A **lecturer** can teach **0 or more modules** (optional for the lecturer).
