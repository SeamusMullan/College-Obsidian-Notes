## Internet structure

Given millions of access networks, how do we connect them.

**Bad idea**
Connect everyone to everyone = O(n^2) connection

**Better Idea**
Have a global transit ISP where customer and provider ISPs have economic agreement

**Flaws**
this introduces competition, multiple ISPs spawn and they may not be connected to each other.

**Solution**
Peering links can be used to interconnect multiple largescale global ISPs

**IXPs**
Internet exchange points are places to connect ISPs between each other.

**Regional Networks**
Smaller than global ISPs, connected to access networks and ISPs. Think national network provider.

**Content Provider Networks**

Private networks eg FAANG / MANGO who provide a service and want to do so as directly as possible.

EG: Netflix store movies on Regional network servers to reduce latency for a region.

**Tier 1 ISPs**
- Global ISPs like AT&T, Sprint, etc.
- Content providers like Google

## Delay, Loss, throughput in networks

### Delay

Propagation -> time for physics to do its thing
### Loss

TCP lowk fixes this

### Throughput

Low throughput usually the users issue, small -> big not as bad as big -> small, imagine a funnel

## Layers

Application
- Actuall app
Transport
- TCP/UDP/ETC
Network
- IP, Routing protocols, networks, ISPs
Link
- Data transfer between neighbors. Frames as network elements. 802.111
physical
- the actual bits on the wire
