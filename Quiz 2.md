> [!question] In $\mathbb{R}^3$ we represent the unit vectors $e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3}$ as $i, j, k$ where $e_{1}$ is the first standard basis vector.
>> [!success]- Answer
>> True

> [!question] The triple product in the given text is a way of calculating the volume of a parallelepiped.
>> [!success]- Answer
>> False

> [!question] The vector U can be written as $$(u - proj_v(U)) - proj_v(U)$$ where the first term is orthogonal to V and the second term is parallel to V.
>> [!success]- Answer
