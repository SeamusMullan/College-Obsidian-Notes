### Risks
- **Complexity:** Handling multiple book metadata sources & inconsistencies.
- **Technical:** OCR accuracy for damaged ISBNs or poor lighting.
- **Integration:** API limits and licensing.
- **Adoption:** Competing with entrenched platforms (Goodreads, Libib).

---

### Feasibility
- **High technical feasibility** (barcode scanning and APIs are well-documented).
- **Medium adoption feasibility** (will depend on UX simplicity and differentiators like offline mode and export tools).
- MVP is achievable within ~2 months of focused Scrum sprints.
