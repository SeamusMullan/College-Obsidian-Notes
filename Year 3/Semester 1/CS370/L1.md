### Module covers:

What are the fundamental capabilities and limits of computers.

**Ultimate mathematical capabilities**
- What is turing recognisable (will it halt)
- What problems are undecidable (will 2 programs do the same thing)
**Practical Limitations**
- What can be solved with a simple program, but takes too much time and isnt feasible (travelling salesman problem)
**Analysis**
- Algorithms
	- How long X takes to run (think O Notation)
- Problems (Computational Complexity)
	- Given a problem, what's easier/harder to solve
	- Upper/Lower bounds, (Proving) optimality of algorithms
