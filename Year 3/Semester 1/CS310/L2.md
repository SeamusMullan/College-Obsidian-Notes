Compilers have a *front end* and a *back end* (not like websites)

We first need to process source code into something the compiler itself can understand (preprocessing) and then the compiler and linker convert the compiled code into a binary which runs on a specific platform (eg .exe for windows, .so for linux).

Brush up on the aul assembly

See slides for breakdown of front and back end differences.

### Lexical Analysis

Breaking instructions down into tokens
```
int i = 0;
```

could split up into
```
> int
> i
> =
> 0
```

where we have a type, a name, an operation and a value split up into seperate *tokens*.

### Syntax analysis

taking source tokens in and checking if they conform to grammar rules (basically check if they are valid code syntax)

### Semantic Analysis

Check if errors exist in the code. parse trees from syntax analysis
