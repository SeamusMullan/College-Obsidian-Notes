## Protocols

*this gonna be like 80% of the course*

Protocols are structured, defined methods we use to communicate between points on a network. The standards, set by the IETF, allow communication between devices with a guarantee that the way devices communicate is the same.

### Some Networking Terms

**Network Edge:** End user devices, clients, servers, data centres, etc.
**Network Core:** Interconnected routers, a network of networks.
**Access Networks:** Wired / Wireless and generic communication links.
- Examples include DSL, Cable, Hybrid Fiber Coax (HFC)
