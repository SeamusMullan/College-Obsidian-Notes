## Non Persistent HTTP

When requesting, files send one by one. eg a browser requests a html file, recieves it and server severs connection. The browser 'discovers' multiple images that need to be requested, requiring more requests and increasing delay for loading

## Persistent HTTP

The server leaves the connection open after sending a response and subsequent HTTP requests can be sent by the client. This reduces the slowdown affect from the Round Trip Time (RTT) since we only need to do it once.

### Sidenote

TCP / HTTP can be run in parallel, some older browsers use this to 'speed up' the loading time. This works well for Non-Persistent HTTP.

### How to make a persistent connection

Lowk just add
```
Keep-Alive: 115\r\n
Connection: keep-alive\r\n
```
to the HTTP request message

where 115 here is the time we want to keep the connection alive for.


## HTTP 1.0 vs 1.1

GET, POST
HEAD: prolly used for testing tbh

1.1 has PUT and DELETE, 1.0 doesn't

PUT for uploading files
DELETE for removing files (at the defined url field)

## Response Codes

200 -> OK
3XX -> Redirection
4XX -> prolly user error
418 -> I'm a teapot
5XX -> prolly server error
