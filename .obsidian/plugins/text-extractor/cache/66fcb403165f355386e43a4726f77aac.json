Registration is currently open on Moodle. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University Introduction – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Course organisation Notes will be a combination of handouts posted on Moodle and notes taken down during the lectures The notes on Moodle will not be enough on their own – there are intentional blank spaces! You must attend the lectures to complete the blank spaces in the notes At the end of each section we’ll do a Summary Song, make sure to warm up your lovely singing voice before class Recommended reading Stats: Data & Models, by De Veaux, Velleman and Bock Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University Introduction – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Statistics in your degree BSc Statistics is available as a Double Honours subject to students in 3rd and 4th year BSc Statistics + Other e.g. BSc Statistics + Applied Mathematics e.g. BSc Statistics + Chemistry e.g. BSc Statistics + Biology Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University Introduction – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Support Any problems please e-mail our departmental office mathsstats@mu.ie Maths Support Centre: http://supportcentre.maths.nuim.ie/ Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University Introduction – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Why study Statistics?

Is this unusual? How large a group do we need for it to be more likely than not that there is a shared birthday? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University Introduction – ST221 Introduction to Statistics The Birthday Problem – Analysis Let the birthdays of the n family members be B1, B2, . . . , Bn Assuming that birthdays are uniformly spread, the probability that B1 and B2 are different is 364 365 If we now consider B3, the probability that this is different from the other two is 363 365 Hence, the probability that all three are different is 364 365 × 363 365 Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University Introduction – ST221 Introduction to Statistics The Birthday Problem – Analysis Let the birthdays of the n family members be B1, B2, . . . , Bn Assuming that birthdays are uniformly spread, the probability that B1 and B2 are different is 364 365 If we now consider B3, the probability that this is different from the other two is 363 365 Hence, the probability that all three are different is 364 365 × 363 365 Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University Introduction – ST221 Introduction to Statistics The Birthday Problem – Analysis Continuing in this way, the probability that all n are different is pn = 364 365 × 363 365 × . . . × 366 − n 365 We have made some assumptions here about the ways in which probabilities multiply together to give the probabilities of combined events – we need to explore this further in the lectures The simplest way to proceed is to write a simple computer programme to tabulate pn against n Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University Introduction – ST221 Introduction to Statistics The Birthday Problem – Analysis n pn n pn 2 0.9973 13 0.8056 3 0.9918 14 0.7769 4 0.9863 15 0.7471 5 0.9729 16 0.7164 6 0.9595 17 0.6850 7 0.9438 18 0.6531 8 0.9257 19 0.6209 9 0.9054 20 0.5886 10 0.8831 21 0.5563 11 0.8589 22 0.5243 12 0.8330 23 0.4927 Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University Introduction – ST221 Introduction to Statistics The Birthday Problem – Analysis ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● 0 10 20 30 40 50 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Number of peopleProbability of shared birthday Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University Introduction – ST221 Introduction to Statistics The Birthday Problem – Analysis ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● 0 10 20 30 40 50 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Number of peopleProbability of shared birthday 28% Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University Introduction – ST221 Introduction to Statistics The Birthday Problem – Discussion We see from the table that only 23 birthdays are needed for there to be greater than a 50% probability of sharing The above analysis ignores leap years and makes two important assumptions 1 that birthdays are spread evenly throughout the year 2 that there is no pattern of birthdays within families Are these assumptions reasonable?
