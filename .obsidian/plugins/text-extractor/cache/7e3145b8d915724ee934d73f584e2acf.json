For example, µ, σ, σ2, π. Sample statistic: Any quantity computed from values in a sample. For example ¯x, s, s 2, p. The value of a population characteristic is fixed, but if you take, for example, 10 samples from a population and compute ¯x for each sample, would you expect each ¯x to be the same? A sample statistic (considered in the context of any possible sample from the population) is a random variable and it has a probability distribution called the ‘sampling distribution’. NB: The ‘sampling distribution’ of a sample statistic is NOT the same as the ‘sample distribution’ which is the distribution of the raw data in the sample. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 5 Sampling distributions and the CLT – ST221 Introduction to Statistics The sampling distribution of the mean Example 1 Suppose exam results in a population are normally distributed with a mean of 51 and a variance of 64. If we take a sample of size 50 from this population, what would we expect a histogram of the data to look like? ¯x1 = 53.03 Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 5 Sampling distributions and the CLT – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example 1 contd Suppose we repeat this process 100 times, i.e. take 100 samples each of size 50 from the N(51, 64) population and record ¯x in each case. ... ¯x2 =53.03 ¯x3=51.81 ¯x4=51.32 ... ¯x100=49.31. What would we expect a histogram of the means from the 100 samples to look like? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 5 Sampling distributions and the CLT – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example 1 contd Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 5 Sampling distributions and the CLT – ST221 Introduction to Statistics The sampling distribution of the mean Example 2 If you roll a fair die, you are equally likely to get any number from 1 to 6, i.e. the distribution of this population is uniform. Suppose we take a sample of size 50 from this population, i.e. roll a die 50 times and record the values. ¯x1 = 3.52 Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 5 Sampling distributions and the CLT – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example 2 contd Suppose we repeat this process 100 times, i.e. take 100 samples each of size 50 from the Uniform[1,6] population and record ¯x in each case. ... ¯x2=3.38 ¯x3=3.48 ¯x4=3.22 ... ¯x100=3.90. What would we expect a histogram of the means from the 100 samples to look like? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 5 Sampling distributions and the CLT – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example 2 contd How would you describe the shape of this data? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 5 Sampling distributions and the CLT – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Recap A sample statistic (considered in the context of any possible sample from the population) is a random variable and it has a probability distribution called the ‘sampling distribution’. NB: The ‘sampling distribution’ of a sample statistic is NOT the same as the ‘sample distribution’ which is the distribution of the raw data in the sample. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 5 Sampling distributions and the CLT – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 5.2 The Central Limit Theorem Any linear combination of n independent random variables has an approximate normal distribution for large n. What does this mean? In practice... What does this NOT mean? In practice... Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 5 Sampling distributions and the CLT – ST221 Introduction to Statistics What does this mean? Algebraically: Suppose X1, ..., Xn are independent random variables with mean E[Xi ] = µi and variance Var(Xi ) = σ2 i . Then for all constants a1, ..., an n∑ i=1 ai Xi ∼ N( n∑ i=1 ai µi , n∑ i=1 a2 i σ2 i ) approximately for large n (usually the approximation works well for n ≥ 30). We can see E [ n∑ i=1 ai Xi ] = n∑ i=1 E [ai Xi ] = n∑ i=1 ai E [Xi ] = n∑ i=1 ai µi and Var ( n∑ i=1 ai Xi ) = n∑ i=1 Var (ai Xi ) = n∑ i=1 a2 i Var (Xi ) = n∑ i=1 a2 i σ2 i Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 5 Sampling distributions and the CLT – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 1. Special case of the CLT Let X1, ..., Xn be independent random variables. Let µ1 = µ2 = ... = µn = µ σ2 1 = σ2 2 = ... = σ2 n = σ2 a1 = a2 = ... = an = 1. Let S = ∑n i=1 Xi . Then S ∼ approx N(nµ, nσ2) We can see that E [ n∑ i=1 Xi ] = n∑ i=1 E [Xi ] = n∑ i=1 µ = nµ and Var ( n∑ i=1 Xi ) = n∑ i=1 Var (Xi ) = n∑ i=1 σ2 = nσ2 Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 5 Sampling distributions and the CLT – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 2. Special case of the CLT Let X1, ..., Xn be independent random variables. Let µ1 = µ2 = ... = µn = µ σ2 1 = σ2 2 = ... = σ2 n = σ2 a1 = a2 = ... = an = 1 n . Let ¯X = ∑n i=1 Xi n .

Suppose that a class of 35 students represents a random sample from the distribution. What is the probability that their average test result is great than 55? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 5 Sampling distributions and the CLT – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 5 Sampling distributions and the CLT – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example An online shop sells t-shirt merchandise from four different television shows. The proportion of t-shirts for each show and the profit per show is A B C D Profit e 1 0.5 3 2 Proportion 0.2 0.4 0.2 0.2 If the store sells 100 t-shirts in a day, what is the probability they make less than e150 profit? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 5 Sampling distributions and the CLT – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 5 Sampling distributions and the CLT – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 5.3 Normal approximation to the binomial Let X ∼ Binomial(n, p). Remember that E[X ]=np and Var(X )=np(1 − p). Then, for large n X ∼ approx N(np, np(1 − p)) To see this, suppose that X = # heads in n tosses of a coin, p=P(Head). We can write X = X1 + ... + Xn, where Xi = 1 if the i th toss is a head and 0 if it is a tail and each Xi ∼ Binomial(n = 1, p). Since X is a sum of independent random variables X1, ..., Xn and each Xi has E[Xi ]=p and Var(Xi )=p(1 − p), then, by the CLT X ∼ approx N(np, np(1 − p)) Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 5 Sampling distributions and the CLT – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 5 Sampling distributions and the CLT – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example O-negative blood can be given to anyone, regardless of the recipient’s blood type. Suppose that 6% of people from a particular population have O-negative blood. A blood donor unit is set up and it samples randomly from this population. It is estimated that it will need at least 1850 units of O-negative blood this year and that it will sample 32000 donors over the course of the year. What is the probability that the unit will fall short of its O-negative requirement? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 5 Sampling distributions and the CLT – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 5 Sampling distributions and the CLT – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Note about continuity correction When approximating a discrete distribution by a continuous distribution, we are using a curve instead of a histogram to calculate probabilities. Example - graphical Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 5 Sampling distributions and the CLT – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Note about continuity correction contd More generally, suppose X is a discrete random variable (takes values on the integer) which can be approximated by a normal random variable X ∗. Then, P(X ≤ x) ≈ P(X ∗ ≤ x + 1 2 ). If follows that P(X < x) ≈ P(X ∗ ≤ x − 1 2 ) P(X ≥ x) ≈ P(X ∗ ≥ x − 1 2 ) P(X > x) ≈ P(X ∗ ≥ x + 1 2 ) P(X = x) ≈ P(x − 1 2 ≤ X ∗ ≥ x + 1 2 ) Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 5 Sampling distributions and the CLT – ST221 Introduction to Statistics","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
