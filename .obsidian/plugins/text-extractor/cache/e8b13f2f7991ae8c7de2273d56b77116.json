The set D = Df is referred as the domain of f . The set Cf := {(x, f (x) : x ∈ D} ⊂ Rn+1 is called the graph of f . • We will denote by z = f (x , y ) the rule of a function of two variables (x , y ) and by w = f (x , y , z) the case of three variables (x , y , z). • Example 1: Let us find the domain of the following functions on R2: f (x , y ) = x 2x − y , g(x , y ) = √1 − x 2 − y 2, h(x , y ) = ln(y − x 2). (1) We must restrict R2 based on the formulae of the three functions. • Df : Here it must be 2x − y ̸= 0. Therefore the domain of f contains all R 2 except the points in the line 2x − y = 0 ⇔ y = 2x below i.e. Df = {(x , y ) ∈ R2 : y ̸= 2x }. Functions of several variables Introduction • Dg : Here it must be 1 − x 2 − y 2 ≥ 0 ⇔ x 2 + y 2 ≤ 1. Therefore the domain of g contains all R2 inside and on the circumference of the circle x 2 + y 2 = 1. i.e. Dg = {(x , y ) ∈ R 2 : x 2 + y 2 ≤ 1} • Dh : Here it must be y − x 2 > 0 ⇔ y > x 2. Therefore the domain of h contains all R2 over the parabola y = x 2. i.e. Dh = {(x , y ) ∈ R2 : y > x 2}. Functions of several variables Introduction Values For finding the value f (x , y ) of a function f : R2 → R, we just replace a given x and y in its formula. In the Example 1, f (2, −4) = 2 2 · 2 − (−4) = 2 8 = 1 4 . (2) g( −1 2 , 1 √ 2 ) = √ 1 − ( −1 2 )2 − ( 1 √ 2 )2 = √ 1 − 1 4 − 1 2 = 1 2 (3) h(−3, 10) = ln(10 − (−3) 2) = ln(10 − 9) = ln 1 = 0. (4) Functions of several variables Introduction Example 2: Find/describe the domains of the functions on R3: f (x , y , z) = x y − z , g(x , y , z) = √z − x 2 − y 2, h(x , y , z) = ln(x 2 + y 2 − 1). (5) Df is entire R3 without the plane y = z; Df = {(x , y , z) ∈ R3 : y ̸= z}. Dg contains all points with z ≥ x 2 + y 2. Which is the points higher than or on the paraboloid z = x 2 + y 2; inside according our intuition . Dh = {(x , y , z) ∈ R3 : x 2 + y 2 > 1} the exterior of the cylinder Kz : x 2 + y 2 = 1 . Functions of several variables Introduction Level sets Let f : Rn ⊃ D → R and c ∈ R. The set Lc (f ) := {x ∈ D : f (x) = c} (6) is referred as the level set of value c of f . For n = 2, Lc (f ) is called a level curve and for n = 3 a level surface. In the case of n = 2, the level curve Lc (f ) consists of the projection in R 2 of the intersection of the graph Cf with the horizontal plane z = c. Functions of several variables Introduction Example 3: Find/describe the level curves of the function f (x , y ) = x 2 + y 2. (7) Cf is a paraboloid and when intersecting with z = c, c > 0 we get circles. here c ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}. Indeed, let c > 0 and set f (x , y ) = c ⇔ x 2 + y 2 = √c 2, which is a circle with center O(0, 0) and radius √c. For c = 0, L0(f ) = {O}, while for c < 0, Lc (f ) = ∅. Functions of several variables Introduction The level curves Lc (f ) of the paraboloid f (x , y ) = x 2 + y 2, for c ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} are as follows: Functions of several variables Introduction Why do we need level curves? • Let f : R2 → R. Then its graph is a surface Cf = {(x , y , z) ∈ R3 : z = f (x , y )}. We need to determine its points. As we saw in the beginning of this module, for clarifying the location of a point P(x , y , z), we must have its projection Q(x , y , 0) at the xy -plane and its projection J(0, 0, z) at z-axis. • When fixing z = c, the level curve Lc (f ) contains exactly the points (x , y ) such that f (x , y ) = z = c, that is the projections at xy -plane of the points of the graph that are in high z = c; i.e. projected at J(0, 0, c) ∈ z-axis. • By doing so for every c ∈ R, we are building the graph of f . We are applying this technique for building the paraboloid z = f (x , y ) = x 2 + y 2 of our previous example: Functions of several variables Introduction The points of the paraboloid with z = c, c ∈ {1/4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}: Functions of several variables Introduction Example 4: Find/describe the level surfaces of the function f (x , y , z) = x 2 + z 2, (x , y , z) ∈ R3. (8) Let c > 0 and set f (x , y , z) = c ⇔ x 2 + z 2 = √c 2, which is a cylinder with radius √c revoluted around y -axis . For c = 0, L0(f ) = {O}, while for c < 0, Lc (f ) = ∅. Functions of several variables Introduction Example 5: Plot the level curves of the function f (x , y ) = x 2 − y 2. Let c > 0 and set f (x , y ) = c ⇔ x 2 − y 2 = √ c 2 ⇔ x 2 √ c2 − y 2 √c2 = 1, which is a hyperbola. Similarly when c < 0 we get the hyperbola y 2 √c2 − x 2 √c2 = 1. When c = 0 we get x 2 = y 2 ⇔ y = ±x , which are the two orthogonal lines y = x and y = −x . The surface z = x 2 − y 2 is called a hyperbolic paraboloid because of its level curves. Functions of several variables Limits Limits: Definition A fundamental notion in Calculus is the one of the limit of a function. Definition Let f : Rn ⊃ D → R and let x0 ∈ Rn such that B(x0, δ)∗ := {x ∈ Rn : 0 < ∥x − x0∥ < δ} ⊂ D, for some δ > 0. When while the independent variable x is approaching x0, then its values f (x) approach a number L ∈ R, we say that the limit of f at x0 is L and we write lim x→x0 f (x) = L. (9) • Other wording is: f tends to L, when x tends to x0; f (x) → L, when x → x0. (10) “Tends\" is often replaced by “approaches\" or “converges\". • When f (x) becomes larger (smaller) than any positive (negative) real number M > 0, while x → x0, we say that it tends to ∞ (−∞) and we write lim x→x0 f (x) = +∞ (−∞). (11) Functions of several variables Limits Limits: Remarks and properties • It is not assumed that f is defined at x0 itself, rather than just around it; it must be B(x0, δ)∗ ⊂ Df , for some δ > 0. • If the limx→x0 f (x) exists, then it is unique. • If limx→x0 fi (x) = Li , i = 1, 2, then lim x→x0(f1(x) + f2(x)) = L1 + L2, similarly for −, ·, : (12) and the same for scalar multiples, powers, roots, composition, under the well-definiteness of every operation applied. • If limx→x0 f (x) exists and it’s real, then f is bounded in a neighbourhood of x0; there exists K > 0 such that for some δ > 0: |f (x)| < K , for every x ∈ Df ∩ B(x0, δ) = {x ∈ Df : ∥x − x0∥ < δ}. (13) When the limit is ±∞, the f is unbounded in a neighbourhood of x0; for every K > 0, there exists δ > 0: |f (x)| > K , for every x ∈ Df ∩ B(x0, δ) ∗. (14) Functions of several variables Limits Limits: Remarks and properties • When x0 ∈ Df and limx→x0 f (x) = f (x0), we say that f is continuous at x0. When f is continuous in every point of its domain, then it is referred simply as continuous. • Polynomial, trigonometric, exponential, logarithmic functions, are continuous (in their domains) and then so do the several operations between them in the corresponding domains. • When x → x0, then xi → x0i , for every i = 1, . . . , n and ∥x − x0∥ → 0. • When g1(x) ≤ f (x) ≤ g2(x), around x0 and lim x→x0 gi (x) = L ∈ R, i = 1, 2, (15) then the limit of f at x0 exists and it is equal with L; lim x→x0 f (x) = L. (16) • Finally (applying the above) we have the equivalence lim x→x0 f (x) = 0 ⇔ lim x→x0 |f (x)| = 0. (17) These properties will be crucial for finding limits. Functions of several variables Limits Example 6: Find the limit of the function f (x , y , z) = x 2 − ey + ln(z − x ) at (1, 0, 2). (18) Things are simple here, as the function is continuous, thanks to the above discussions lim (x ,y ,z)→(1,0,2) f (x , y , z) = f (1, 0, 2) = 1 2 − e0 + ln(2 − 1) = 1 − 1 + 0 = 0. (19) Functions of several variables Limits Example 7: Show that the limit lim (x ,y )→(0,0) ( x 3 x 2 + y 2 + ex +y ) = 1. (20) S1. We look at the exponential term first which obviously gives lim (x ,y )→(0,0) ex +y = e0+0 = 1. (21) S2. About the quotient of polynomials x 3 x 2+y 2 , I cannot replace x = 0 and y = 0, as the function is not defined at the point (0, 0). Moreover, when (x , y ) → (0, 0) we have lim (x ,y )→(0,0) x 3 = 0 = lim (x ,y )→(0,0)(x 2 + y 2); limit of the form ( 0 0 ). (22) Functions of several variables Limits S3. Let us bound from above the absolute value of the fraction. We start with an obvious but extremely useful inequality: |x | = √x 2 ≤ √x 2 + y 2 , (23) with the right hand term still tending to 0! We use this inequality to extract 0 ≤ ∣ ∣ ∣ x 3 x 2 + y 2 ∣ ∣ ∣ = |x 3| |x 2 + y 2| = |x |3 x 2 + y 2 (24) ≤ √ x 2 + y 23 x 2 + y 2 = (x 2 + y 2) √x 2 + y 2 x 2 + y 2 = √x 2 + y 2. (25) But of course lim (x ,y )→(0,0) 0 = 0 = lim (x ,y )→(0,0) √x 2 + y 2, (26) therefore lim (x ,y )→(0,0) x 3 x 2 + y 2 = 0 =⇒ lim (x ,y )→(0,0) ( x 3 x 2 + y 2 + ex +y ) = 0 + 1 = 1. (27) Functions of several variables Limits Methodology The above ideas may help us find several limits like in Example 7. In S1 we clarified where the “easy\" parts of the function are tending. In S2 we detected the interesting (0/0) part; denote here as f1(x , y ). In S3 we proved that 0 ≤ |f1(x , y )| ≤ g2(x , y ) → 0, (28) for some function g2. This meant that |f1(x , y )| → 0, therefore f1(x , y ) → 0. The last combined with the first step, ends the exercise. As we understand the main trick was the tight bound in (28). Let us see tools that we can use in this direction: • We have (x , y ) → (0, 0), which means that x , y → 0. Also x α, y α → 0, for every α > 0. • Moreover |x |, |y | ≤ √x 2 + y 2 → 0. • Other inequalities such as |sin(x )| ≤ |x | could be used to confirm the bound (28). • Maybe some direct algebra may help to avoid the (0/0)-indeterminacy, as we will see in the next Functions of several variables Limits Example 8: Show that the limit lim (x ,y )→(0,0) ( x 2 − y 2 √x − √y − x 2 + 2 cos(y ) ) = 2. (29) S1. We look at the safe term first which obviously gives lim (x ,y )→(0,0)(−x 2 + 2 cos(xy )) = −02 + 2 cos(0 · 0) = 2. (30) S2. About the quotient f1(x , y ) := x 2−y 2 √ x − √y , obviously is of the undetermined form (0/0). S3. Although some elementary algebra can be applied: Functions of several variables Limits f1(x , y ) = x 2 − y 2 √x − √y = (x − y )(x + y )( √x + √y ) ( √x − √y )( √x + √y ) (31) = (x − y )(x + y )( √x + √y ) x − y = (x + y )( √x + √y ), (32) which is not in an undetermined form any more and gives lim (x ,y )→(0,0) f1(x , y ) = lim (x ,y )→(0,0) (x + y )( √x + √y ) = 0 (33) =⇒ lim (x ,y )→(0,0) ( x 2 − y 2 √x − √y − x 2 + 2 cos(y )) = 2. (34) Functions of several variables Limits Example 9: Show that the function f : R3 → R with formula f (x , y , z) = { (x +y )2−2z 2 √x 2+y 2+z 2 , (x , y , z) ̸= (0, 0, 0) 1, , (x , y , z) = (0, 0, 0) (35) is not continuous at the origin. We have f (0, 0, 0) = 1 and we are looking for the limit lim(x ,y ,z)→(0,0,0) f (x , y , z). We immediately note that it is a limit of an undetermined (0/0) form. We are trying to get a tight upper bound for |f (x , y , z)|. By the triangle inequality of the absolute value we take |(x + y )2 − 2z 2| ≤ |(x + y )2| + |2z 2| = (|x + y |) 2 + 2z 2 (36) ≤ (|x | + |y |) 2 + 2z 2 = x 2 + 2|x ||y | + y 2 + 2z 2. (37) Functions of several variables Limits Recall now that |x |, |y | ≤ √x 2 + y 2 + z 2, thus |x ||y | ≤ √x 2 + y 2 + z 2√x 2 + y 2 + z 2 = x 2 + y 2 + z 2. (38) Also, obviously x 2 + y 2 + 2z 2 ≤ 2(x 2 + y 2 + z 2). (39) All the above together imply 0 ≤ |f (x , y , z)| = |(x + y ) 2 − 2z 2| √ x 2 + y 2 + z 2 ≤ 4(x 2 + y 2 + z 2) √x 2 + y 2 + z 2 (40) = 4√ x 2 + y 2 + z 2 → 0, (41) and therefore lim(x ,y ,z)→(0,0,0) f (x , y , z) = 0 ̸= 1 = f (0, 0, 0) so the function f is not continuous at the origin. Functions of several variables Limits Limits through paths • Let f : R → R a single variable function and x0 ∈ R. The approach of x to x0 could happen in just two possible ways; from the left (x → x − 0 ) and the right (x → x + 0 ), which is exactly through the rays (−∞, x0) and (x0, +∞). • When f : Rn → R and x0 ∈ Rn for some n ≥ 2, this approach can happen in infinity many ways, referred as paths. • If the limit exists, it is unique. Thus if we find two different paths giving different limit values, then the limit does not exist! • This is our general methodology for proving the non-existence of limits! • On the other hand, if a large family of paths give a particular limit value, then this is a good indication (of course not a proof!!) that this value has some chances to be the limit of the function. Functions of several variables Limits Paths to the origin In the next plot we present several paths tending to O(0, 0) ∈ R2 Algebraically the paths can be of the form x = 0, y = 0, y = λx , λ ∈ R (42) or another way such as y = λx 2 etc. Similarly for any other point x0 ∈ Rn. Functions of several variables Limits Non-existence of a limit In the next plot we present the behaviour of the function f (x , y ) = x 2/(x 2 + y 2), when (x , y ) tending to O(0, 0) ∈ R2 Through the y axes, the values of f are f (0, y ) = 0 → 0. Through the x axes, the values are f (x , 0) = 1 → 1 ̸= 0, and the limit does not exist. Functions of several variables Limits Example 10: Show that the limit of the function f (x , y ) = 2x 2 − y 2 x 2 + y 2 (43) at the origin does not exist. The simplest possible paths are the axes. We use these here. (i) Let Py : x = 0, the path of y -axis. Then lim (x ,y )→(0,0);x =0 f (x , y ) = lim y →0 f (0, y ) = lim y →0 2 · 0 2 − y 2 02 + y 2 = −1. (44) Remark: if the limit exists, then it must be −1. If I find another path giving a different answer, then the limit just doesn’t exist. (ii) Let Px : y = 0, which gives f (x , 0) = 2 → 2, i.e. the limit does not exist. Functions of several variables Limits Example 11: Show that the limit lim (x ,y )→(0,0) x 2 − y 3 xy (45) does not exist. Let f (x , y ) = x 2−y 3 xy . Here the y -axis and x -axis paths are not applicable, because f is not defined on the axes! I must find an alternative. Then next simplest paths are the lines Pλ : y = λx , approaching the origin. Let λ ∈ R∗ and (x , y ) ∈ Pλ; y = λx , then Functions of several variables Limits lim (x ,y )→(0,0),y =λx f (x , y ) = lim x →0 f (x , λx ) = lim x →0 x 2 − λ3x 3 λx 2 (46) = lim x →0 1 − λ3x λ = 1 λ . (47) The limit is λ-depended, i.e. depends on the path, which breaks the uniqueness of the limit and therefore the limit does not exist and the claim has been proved. If I want to see further details, I choose λ1 = 1 and λ2 = 2. From the above we have that lim (x ,y )→(0,0),y =x f (x , y ) = 1 ̸= 1 2 = lim (x ,y )→(0,0),y =2x f (x , y ), (48) which implies the non-existence of the limit. Functions of several variables Limits Example 12: Show that the limit lim (x ,y )→(0,0) x 2 + y y (49) does not exist. Let f (x , y ) = x 2+y y . Here the path through the y axis: x = 0 gives lim (x ,y )→(0,0);x =0 f (x , y ) = lim y →0 f (0, y ) = 1. (50) Although the x -axis y = 0 is not available based on the function’s domain. My next idea is to check the paths Pλ : y = λx . Let λ ∈ R∗. Then lim (x ,y )→(0,0),Pλ f (x , y ) = lim x →0 f (x , λx ) = lim x →0 x 2 + λx λx (51) = lim x →0 x + λ λ = 1 again!. (52) At the moment, there is no answer to our problem, because via all paths studied, f converges to the same limit (here 1). Functions of several variables Limits Although close to start thinking of the limit being 1 (as all path-limits so far), the formula of f inspires me to check the connection between y and x 2 as in the numerator of f (x , y ). We will check parabolic paths: Πλ : y = λx 2, λ ∈ R ∗. (53) Let λ ∈ R∗, then lim (x ,y )→(0,0);Πλ f (x , y ) = lim x →0 f (x , λx 2) = lim x →0 x 2 + λx 2 λx 2 = 1 + λ λ (54) i.e. λ-dependent which confirms that the limit does not exist. Functions of several variables Limits Example 13: Show that the limit lim (x ,y )→(1,2) (x + y − 3)2 (x − 1)(y − 2) , does not exist. (55) Let f (x , y ) = (x +y −3)2 (x −1)(y −2) . When (x , y ) → (1, 2), I must look for paths tending to this point and so the axes are not eligible. Checking the vertical line x = 1 and the horizontal line y = 2, we observe that the function f (x , y ) is not defined there, so we must check other paths. We start thinking of linear paths crossing (1, 2). One of them is given by P1 : y = 2x , because when x → 1 then y → 2. Here it holds that lim (x ,y )→(1,2);P1 f (x , y ) = lim x →1 f (x , 2x ) = lim x →1 (x + 2x − 3)2 (x − 1)(2x − 2) (56) = lim x →1 (3x − 3) 2 (x − 1)2(x − 1) = lim x →1 9(x − 1)2 2(x − 1)2 = 9 2 . (57) Functions of several variables Limits We focus now at the path P2 : y = x + 1. Here we take lim (x ,y )→(1,2);P2 f (x , y ) = lim x →1 f (x , x + 1) = lim x →1 (x + x − 2) 2 (x − 1)(x − 1) (58) = lim x →1 (2x − 2)2 (x − 1)2 = lim x →1 4(x − 1)2 (x − 1)2 = lim x →1 4 = 4 ̸= 9 2 , (59) so the limit does not exist. Functions of several variables Limits Example 14: Does exist the limit lim (x ,y )→(0,0) 2x 3 − 4y 5 x 2 + y 2 ? (60) We consider the function f (x , y ) = 2x 3−4y 5 x 2+y 2 . The path on y -axis gives f (0, y ) = −4y 3 → 0, when y → 0. The path on x -axis gives f (x , 0) = 2x → 0, when x → 0. We are looking at the paths Pλ : y = λx : here f (x , λx ) = 2x 3 − 4λ 5x 5 (1 + λ2)x 2 = 2x − 4λ 5x 3 1 + λ2 → 0, (61) when x → 0. Functions of several variables Limits Naturally we are thinking of a zero limit as through all paths above. Recall that |a ± b| ≤ |a| + |b| and that |x |, |y | ≤ √x 2 + y 2. Then |2x 3 − 4y 5| ≤ 2|x |3 + 4|y |5 ≤ 2 √x 2 + y 23 + 4 √x 2 + y 25 (62) ≤ 6√x 2 + y 23, (63) where for the above we assume that: q := x 2 + y 2 ≤ 1, which gives q5 ≤ q3. Then 0 ≤ |f (x , y )| ≤ 6√ x 2 + y 23 x 2 + y 2 = 6√x 2 + y 2 → 0, (64) which is all we need to obtain that lim(x ,y )→(0,0) 2x 3−4y 5 x 2+y 2 = 0.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
