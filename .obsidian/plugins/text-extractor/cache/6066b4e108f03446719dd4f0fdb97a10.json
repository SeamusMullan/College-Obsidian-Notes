Number of people waiting at an ATM. Number of malfunctioning components in a batch of 100. Height and weight of a randomly selected person. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Types of random variables A continuous random variable takes values anywhere on the real line R or on a subset of R. A discrete random variable takes values on the integers or on a subset of the integers. Examples X = weight of a randomly chosen person: any value (0, ∞). X = number of people waiting at an ATM: 0 , 1, 2, 3.... For now we will focus on discrete random variables. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 2.1 The probability mass function and cumulative distribution function Example Toss a coin 3 times. Ω = {HHH, HHT , HTH, THH, HTT , THT , TTH, TTT }. There are 8 equally likely outcomes. Let X = the number of heads observed. Then X is a discrete random variable with possible values: 0, 1, 2, 3. What is the probability mass function of X ? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Probability mass function In general, a probability mass function for a discrete random variable X is a function, p, such that p(x) = P(X = x) Note p(x) ≥ 0 ∀ x ∑ x p(x) = 1 Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example: Back to the tossing of three coins experiment. X = number of heads in 3 tosses. Show that p(x) is a valid probability mass function. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Cumulative distribution function The cumulative distribution function of a random variable is a function F such that F (x) = P(X ≤ x) = ∑ k≤x p(k) Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example: Back to the tossing of three coins experiment. X = number of heads in 3 tosses. Give the cumulative distribution function for X . Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example Let X denote the number of accidents at a busy intersection in a week. Based on historical information, we know that: x 0 1 2 3 4 P(X = x) 0.4 0.3 0.15 0.1 0.05 Questions: 1 Is this a valid pmf? 2 Graph p. 3 Find F . 4 Graph F . Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 2.2 Expectation and Variance Definition: The expected value of a discrete random variable is defined as E [X ] = ∑ x xP(X = x) Note: E[X ] is often called the mean of the random variable and is denoted by µ. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example: Back to the accidents example. Compute the expected value of X . Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Lemma: For some continuous function g , E [g (X )] = ∑ x g (x)p(x) Definition: The variance of a random variable X is Var (X ) = E [(X − µ)2] Notes 1 The variance of X is denote by σ2. 2 The variance is the expected squared distance of X from µ. 3 An equivalent formula is Var (X ) = E [X 2] − µ2 = E [X 2] − (E [X ])2 Definition: The standard deviation of a random variable X is σ = √Var (X ) Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example: Back to the accidents example. Find Var(X ). Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example Suppose X takes values -1, 0, 1 each with probability 1 3 . 1 Find E[X ]. 2 Find Var(X ). Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Some notes on expected values Discrete random variables: E [X ] = ∑ x xp(x). probability weighted sum of possible values. Continuous random variables: E [X ] = ∫ xf (x)dx. f (x) will be defined later. probability weighted integral of possible values. Expected value ̸= most probably value and is not necessarily a value that the random variable can take or that it typically takes. It is the long run average over many independent repetitions. Probability can be considered as the long run relative frequency. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Types of discrete distributions For the remainder of this section we will look at ’special’ types of discrete distributions. These are the: Bernoulli distribution Binomial distribution Poisson distribution Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 2.3 The Bernoulli Distribution A ’Bernoulli trial’ or ’Bernoulli random variable’ is where there are just two possible outcomes which we denote either a ’success’ or a ’failure’. Example Toss a coin: Head = success = 1, Tail = failure = 0. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Properties of the Bernoulli distribution Probability mass function p(x) =    p if x = 1 q if x = 0 0 otherwise where q = 1 − p. Expected value E[X ] = 0 × P[X = 0] + 1 × P[X = 1] = p Variance E[X 2] = 02 × P[X = 0] + 12 × P[X = 1] = p Var(X ) = E[X 2] - (E [X ])2 = p − p2 = p(1 − p) = pq Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example If in the rolling of a fair die, the event of obtaining a 4 or 6 is called a success and 1, 2, 3, 5 a failure, what is the E[X ] and Var(X )? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 2.4 The Binomial Distribution If n Bernoulli trials all with probability p are performed independently, then X , the number of successes out of the n trials is said to be a binomial random variable with parameters n and p. Examples 1 Toss a coin 10 times. On each toss the probability of getting a tail is 0.5. Let X = # tails obtained. We write X ∼ Binomial(n = 10, p = 0.5). 2 A multiple choice test has 100 questions. Each question has four possible answers. A student does not know anything about the subject and so the probability of a correct answer is 0.25. We write X ∼ Binomial(n = 100, p = 0.25). Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Assumptions for a binomial random variable At each trial there are two possible outcomes: ’success’ or ’failure’. Trials are independent. The probability (p) of success at each trial is constant. There is a fixed number (n) of identical trials. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Properties of the binomial distribution If X ∼ Binomial(n, p), the possible outcomes are 0, 1, 2, ..., n. Probability mass function P(X = x) = (n x ) px (1 − p)n−x Expected value E[X ] = np Variance Var(X ) = np(1 − p) = npq Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example Let X = no. of tails in 5 tosses of a coin. 1 What distribution does X have? 2 What values can X take? 3 Find the probability mass function of X . 4 Find the E[X ]. 5 What is the P(X ≤ 2)? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example Suppose that 5% of the Irish population are colour blind. Let X = # colour blind people in a random sample of 100 people. 1 What is the probability that the sample has no colour blind people? 2 What is the probability that the sample has one colour blind person? 3 What is the probability that the sample has two or more colour blind people? 4 Find the E[X ] and Var(X ).

Examples 1 Number of plankton in a litre of water. 2 Number of calls per hour to a helpline. 3 Number of earthquakes in a year. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Properties of the Poisson distribution If X is a Poisson random variable it takes values 0, 1, 2, 3,.... We say that X ∼ Poisson(λ). Probability mass function P(X = x) = e −λλx x! Expected value E[X ] = λ Variance Var(X ) = λ Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example The number of calls per hour to a computer helpline is approximated by a Poisson random variable with mean 3. We say that X ∼ Poisson(λ = 3). 1 Find (a) P(X = 0) (b) P(X = 1) (c) P(X = 2) (d) P(X = 3) Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example contd. The number of calls per hour to a computer helpline is approximated by a Poisson random variable with mean 3. We say that X ∼ Poisson(λ = 3). 2 What is the probability of getting no calls in a two hour period? 3 What is the probability of getting one call in a two hour period? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example On average 6.7 patients arrive in a doctor’s office in 1 hour. Arrivals follow a Poisson distribution. 1 What is the probability of at most 3 patients arriving in the next hour? 2 What is the probability of exactly 5 people arriving in the next 90 minutes? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 2 Discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example Suppose that the occurrence of earthquakes in a particular region of California follows a Poisson distribution with a rate of 7 per year on average. 1 What is the probability of no earthquakes in one year? 2 What is the probability that in exactly 1 of the next 8 years no earthquakes will occur?
