(1) Every point can be represented as the corresponding pair of Cartesian coordinates (René Descartes): The Euclidean space R n Introduction The x -axis and y -axes are orthogonal and intersect at the point O(0, 0). Every point is denoted by P, P(x0, y0), P = (x0, y0). The lines of the form x = x0, are parallel to y -axis, and in particular the y -axis itself has the equation y -axis : x = 0. As a set it can be expressed as y -axis = {(0, y ) : y ∈ R}. Similarly the lines y = y0 are parallel to x -axis; horizontal. Then x -axis : y = 0 and x -axis = {(x , 0) : x ∈ R}. The Euclidean plane consists of 4 quadrants. We enumerate from 1 to 4 starting from top-right to bottom-right. In the next example B is in the 2nd and C in the 3rd quadrant, while O lies in all of them. Confirm the coordinates and equation of horizontal and vertical lines . The Euclidean space R n Introduction More points The Euclidean space R n Introduction The Euclidean space R3 Our geometric intuition of the space around us can be expressed by the Euclidean space R3 = {(x , y , z) : x , y , z ∈ R}. This time we need 3 axes; x,y and z. We may represent them in the page as follows The Euclidean space R n Introduction • The x -axis contains all points with y = 0 and z = 0 x -axis := {(x , 0, 0) : x ∈ R} i.e. its (system of) equation(s) is x -axis : {y = 0, z = 0 (2) Similarly for the other two axes . • The xy -plane contains all points with z = 0; xy−plane :z=0 . xy -plane := {(x , y , 0) : x , y ∈ R}. What about the other two coordinate planes ? • The three planes divide R 3 in 3 octants. The first of them is oct1 := {(x , y , z) ∈ R3 : x , y , z ≥ 0}. • Note above that with one equation like z = 0 on R3, we take a plane. A surface of dimension 2 that we will say later. For taking a line, like the axes, we needed two consistent equations like that! We will further elaborate on this in the sequel. • We represent a point P(x , y , z) by (i) finding its projection Q(x , y , 0) at the xy -plane and (ii) its projection J(0, 0, z) in the z axis. The Euclidean space R n Introduction The Euclidean space R n Introduction For another example consider the following cube of the first octant with edge 1. Here A(1, 0, 0), B(1, 1, 0), G(0, 1, 1) are three of its vertices; the other 5? . The six faces are lying at the planes x = 0, x = 1 (back, front), y = 0, y = 1 (left, right) and z = 0, z = 1 (down, up). The Euclidean space R n Introduction General form of planes on R3 Every plane has an analytic equation of the form αx + βy + γz + δ = 0. (α, β, γ) ̸= (0, 0, 0). (3) Below we can see the plane x + 2y + 3z = 4 and three points A(1, 0, 1), B(0, 2, 0) and C (−1, 1, 1) on it. The Euclidean space R n Introduction Lines as planes’ intersections Two planes of the form αx + βy + γz + δi = 0. δ1 ̸= δ2. (4) are parallel. Otherwise two non-parallel planes intersect defining a line. In the next figure we can see the line ℓ : x + 2y + 3z = 4, x + y = z + 2. (5) The Euclidean space R n Introduction Distance The distance d(A, B) = (AB) = |AB| between two points on R2, or R 3 is defined by the Pythagorean Theorem; |AB| = c = √ a2 + b2; Let A(x , y , z), B(x ′, y ′, z ′). Their distance equals |AB| := √ (x − x ′)2 + (y − y ′)2+(z − z ′)2. (6) The Euclidean space R n Introduction • For example the distance between the points A(1, 2, 3) and B(−3, 14, 6) of R3 is |AB| = √(1 − (−3))2 + (2 − 14)2 + (3 − 6)2 (7) = √16 + 144 + 9 = √ 169 = 13. (8) • A sphere is the set of points that are all at the same distance r > 0 from a given point C . The point C is the center of the sphere, and r is its radius. • The interior points are of distance less than r from the centre and the exterior of distance more than r from the centre. The above definition immediately leads to the following. The Euclidean space R n Introduction Spheres The sphere of radius r > 0 centred at C (x0, y0, z0) has the equation (x − x0)2 + (y − y0) 2 + (z − z0) 2 = r 2 (9) Below we can see the spheres centred at the origin of radii 1 (left) and 3 (right) The sets of points P(x , y , z) with (x − x0)2 + (y − y0)2 + (z − z0) 2 < r 2 (> r 2) (10) consist of the interior (exterior) of the above sphere. The Euclidean space R n Vectors on R n Vectors • The following notion coming from Algebra will be of high importance in our study. • As a vector of R 2 (or R3) we refer to every directional linear segment; u := ⃗u := −→ AB := AB. We refer to the point A as its start and the point B as its end and the size or length of the vector, is exactly the size of the corresponding linear segment, the distance between A and B; |u| := | −→ AB| := |AB|. • Two vectors are equal when they have the same direction and size. This means that we can move (but not rotate) a vector, while keeping it invariant. • Velocity, acceleration, and force are typical examples of vectors. • A vector u = (u1, u2, u3) on R3 (similarly R2) represent the change between the start and end points by u1 (positive/negative) in the first coordinate, u2 in the second and u3 in the third. In other words the vector −→ AB with start at the point A(a1, a2, a3) and end at B(b1, b2, b3) is −→ AB = (b1 − a1, b2 − a2, b3 − a3). (11) The Euclidean space R n Vectors on R n The vector u = (1, 2) on the plane: The Euclidean space R n Vectors on R n Identification between points and vectors Every vector u = (x , y ) (say on R2, but similarly for R3) can be moved so that to has its start on the origin O(0, 0) and its end at the point B(x , y ), i.e. u = −→ OB. It will be very often convenient to identify every point B(x , y ) with the vector −→ OB = (x , y ) = u. Several times we further identify the letters used; point P(x , y ) and vector p = (x , y ), without extra emphasis. The Euclidean space R n Vectors on R n Rn Let n ∈ N. The Euclidean space of dimension n is defined as the set of all points/vectors with n real coordinates: Rn := {x = (x1, . . . , xn) : xi ∈ R, i = 1, . . . , n}. (12) • In particular R 3, R2 and R1 are referred as the Euclidean space, plane and line respectively. • We commonly use (x , y ) and (x , y , z) for the points/vectors of R2 and R 3 respectively. Whenever we are on R2 or R3 the coordinates’ correspondence is x1 = x , x2 = y and x3 = z. • The vector 0 := ⃗0 := (0, . . . , 0) is referred as the zero vector of R n and plays the role of multi-dimensional analogous of the zero real number. The Euclidean space R n Vectors on R n Vector operations; recap from Linear algebra Consider x = (x1, . . . , xn), y = (y1, . . . , yn) ∈ Rn and λ ∈ R. • The vectors x and y are equal, when all of their corresponding coordinates are equal to each other; x = y ⇔ xi = yi , for every i = 1, . . . , n. (13) • Their sum x + y and their difference x − y are the vectors of Rn given below: x + y = (x1 + y1, . . . , xn + yn) x − y = (x1 − y1, . . . , xn − yn). (14) • The opposite vector of x is given by −x := (−x1, . . . , −xn). (15) •The scalar product between λ and x is the vector: λx := (λx1, . . . , λxn). (16) The Euclidean space R n Vectors on R n Visually: sum; Parallelogram rule Let sum and difference of two vectors are obtained by the parallelogram low. Below u + v = −→ OA + −→ OB = −→ OA + −→ AC = −→ OC is in red and u − v is in green The Euclidean space R n Vectors on R n Vector Properties Let x, y, z ∈ Rn and λ, µ ∈ R. Recall the next fundamental properties: x + y = y + x. x + 0 = 0 + x = x. (x + y) + z = x + (y + z) =: x + y + z. λ(x + y) = λx + λy. (λ + µ)x = λx + µx. λ(µx) = (λµ)x. 1x = x 0x = 0. λ0 = 0. The Euclidean space R n Vectors on R n Vector equation of a line • So far we have seen analytic equations of lines on R 2 and R 3 (as intersections of planes). Vectors can be employed for obtaining further expressions of line equations. • A line passing through the point P(p1, p2, p3) with direction d = (d1, d2, d3) ̸= 0 has the following vector equation: x = p + td, for every t ∈ R. (17) (recall that p = −→ OP = (p1, p2, p3)) Which may represented coordinate-wise as x1 = p1 + td1, x2 = p2 + td2, x3 = p3 + td3, t ∈ R (18) • The equation of a line defined by two different points P(p1, p2, p3), Q(q1, q2, q3) can be obtained as above with d := −→ PQ. • All the above hold exactly in the same way for lines on R n, for every n. The Euclidean space R n Vectors on R n Vector equation of a line: illustration Let us draw the line passing from P(4, 2) with direction d = (1, 2): The Euclidean space R n Vectors on R n Example: For example we will determine the vector equation of the line of R3 passing through the points P(2, 5, −1) and Q(2, 3, 0). The directional vector is d := −→ PQ = (2 − 2, 3 − 5, 0 − (−1)) = (0, −2, 1). (19) Then every vector x in the line of P, Q satisfies x = p + td = (2, 5, −1) + t(0, −2, 1) = (2, 5 − 2t, −1 + t), t ∈ R. (20) or x1 = 2, x2 = 5 − 2t, x3 = −1 + t, t ∈ R. (21) • For t = 0 we take the point P. For t = 1 we have the point Q. • The line defined by P and Q lies on the plane x1 = 2. Therefore it is perpendicular to the x -axis (recall x1 = x ) and/or never intersects the yz-plane. The Euclidean space R n Vectors on R n Let’s plot it The Euclidean space R n Vectors on R n Recall the dot product, norm and angle Let x = (x1, . . . , xn), y = (y1, . . . , yn) ∈ Rn. (i) The dot product x · y is the real number x · y := x1y1 + · · · + xnyn =: n∑ i=1 xi yi . (22) (ii) The norm ∥x∥ (or the length) of the vector x; ∥x∥ := √ x · x = √x 2 1 + · · · + x 2 n = ( n∑ i=1 x 2 i )1/2. (23) (iii) If x, y ̸= 0, the angle θ := ( ̂x, y) is defined as the unique number of [0, π] such that cos(θ) = x · y ∥x∥∥y∥ . (24) The Euclidean space R n Vectors on R n Recall the fundamental properties of dot product and norm x · y = y · x. x · (y + z) = x · y + x · z. (λx) · y = x · (λy) = λ(x · y). 0 · x = 0. ∥x∥ ≥ 0 and ∥x∥ = 0 ⇔ x = 0. [Positivity] ∥λx∥ = |λ|∥x∥. [Homogeneity] ∥x + y∥ ≤ ∥x∥ + ∥y∥. [Triangle inequality] |x · y | ≤ ∥x ∥∥y ∥. [Cauchy-Schwarz inequality] cos(θ) = 1 ⇔ x = λy, for some λ > 0 (parallel and of the same direction); i.e. θ = 0. Similarly cos(θ) = −1 ⇔ x = λy, for some λ < 0 (parallel and of the opposite direction); i.e. θ = π. Two vectors are called orthogonal when x · y = 0. The zero vector is orthogonal to every vector and when x, y ̸= 0, the angle of two vectors is π/2 if and only if x · y = 0. A vector v ∈ Rn is called a unit vector when ∥v∥ = 1. For every non-zero vector u, the vector v := u/∥u∥ is a unit vector of the same direction. The Euclidean space R n Vectors on R n Example Let A(0, 3, 4), B(0, −4, 3) and C (1, 0, −1) and a, b, c the corresponding vectors. (i) Find the cosine of the angle ̂BOC , (ii) show that ̂AOB = π/2. (i) Observe that ̂BOC = ̂(b, c). Note also that ∥b∥ = 5 and ∥c∥ = √2. We find their dot product b · c = 0 · 1 + (−4) · 0 + 3 · (−1) = −3, (25) thus cos( ̂BOC ) = cos( ̂b, c) = b · c ∥b∥∥c∥ = −3 5√ 2 . (26) (ii) As before a · b = 0 − 12 + 12 = 0, so the vectors are orthogonal; their angle is π/2. The Euclidean space R n Vectors on R n Let us see the points, the vectors and the yz-plane: x = 0, because A and B lie there! The Euclidean space R n Vectors on R n Standard unit vectors • The standard unit vectors of Rn are the vectors {e1, e2, . . . , en}, where e1 = (1, 0, . . . , 0), e2 = (0, 1, 0, . . . , 0), . . . , en = (0, 0, . . . , 0, 1), (27) (ei has all coordinates 0, but i-th coordinate which is 1). • These are orthogonal to each other; ei · ej = 0, ∀i ̸= j. • Let v = (v1, v2, . . . , vn) ∈ Rn. Then we can express it as a unique linear combination of e1, . . . , en: v = v1e1 + · · · + vnen. (28) • Geometrically the ei vector is the unit vector parallel to the xi -axis in the positive direction. • In the literature, when n = 3, the vectors e1, e2, e3 of R3 may appear as i, j, k respectively. The Euclidean space R n Vectors on R n Orthogonal projections Let u, v ̸= 0. Then orthogonal projection of u on v is defined as the vector Projv(u) := u · v ∥v∥2 v. (29) Then: Projv(u) ∥ v, Projv(u) · v = u · v, (u − Projv(u)) · v = 0. (30) In the figure u = −→ AB, v = −→ AC , then w = Projv(u) = −→ AD and a = u − Projv(u) = −→ DB. The Euclidean space R n Vectors on R n The cross product on R3 • We restrict on R3 and let e1 = (1, 0, 0), e2 = (0, 1, 0) and e3 = (0, 0, 1) the standard unit vectors. Let a = (a1, a2, a3), b = (b1, b2, b3) ∈ R3. The cross product a × b ∈ R 3 is the vector defined as a × b = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ e1 e2 e3 a1 a2 a3 b1 b2 b3 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ (expand the first row of the determinant) (31) = (a2b3 − a3b2)e1 + (a3b1 − a1b3)e2 + (a1b2 − a2b1)e3. (32) • Let a, b, c ∈ R 3. The real number a · (b × c) is referred as their triple product. It turns out that a · (b × c) = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ a1 a2 a3 b1 b2 b3 c1 c2 c3 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ =: det[a, b, c]. (33) The Euclidean space R n Vectors on R n Interpretation and properties 0 × b = a × 0 = 0, for every a, b ∈ R3. More generally, when a and b are parallel (i.e. a = λb, for some λ ∈ R), then a × b = 0. For instance a × a = 0. The cross product a × b is orthogonal to both a and b. When a and b are not parallel, then a × b is orthogonal to every vector in the plane defined by a and b. a × b = −b × a (anticommutativity). e1 × e2 = e3, e2 × e3 = e1 and e3 × e1 = e2. But e1 × e3 = −e2, etc. ∥a × b∥ = ∥a∥∥b∥| sin(θ)|, where θ = ( ̂a, b) and therefore it is equal with the area of the parallelogram defined by a and b. a × (b + c) = a × b + a × c. (λa) × b = a × (λb) = λ(a × b). The Euclidean space R n Vectors on R n Jacobi identity: a × (b × c) + b × (c × a) + c × (a × b) = 0. (34) Clearly when any two of a, b and c are parallel, a · (b × c) = 0. When there is not any couple of parallel vectors between a, b and c, these are defining a parallelepiped having as edges the vectors a, b and c. This solid is expressed by the set of the following linear combinations: Par(a, b, c) = { u = λa + µb + νc : 0 ≤ λ, µ, ν ≤ 1 } . (35) The volume of the parallelepiped is the absolute value of the triple product, or of the determinant of the three vectors! Vol(Par(a, b, c)) = |a · (b × c)| = |det[a, b, c]| (36) The Euclidean space R n Vectors on R n Example Let a = (0, 3, 4), b = (0, −4, 3) and c = (1, 0, −1) as before. Find (i) the orthogonal projection of a on c, (ii) two vectors a1 and a2 such that a = a1 + a2 and a1 being parallel with c and a2 orthogonal with c , (iii) the cross product of b and c, (iv) the area of the parallelogram defined by b and c (vi) the volume of the parallelepiped defined by a, b and c. (i) For the orthogonal projection a1 = Projc(a), we take a · c = 0 · 1 + 3 · 0 + 4 · (−1) = −4. Then a1 = Projc(a) = a · c ∥c∥2 c = −4 2 c = −2c = (−2, 0, 2). (37) (ii) The vector a2 which is orthogonal with c, is then a2 = a − Projc(a) = (0, 3, 4) − (−2, 0, 2) = (2, 3, 2). (38) (iii) For the cross product b × c = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ i j k 0 −4 3 1 0 −1 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = i(−4)(−1) − j(−3 · 1) + k(−(−4) · 1) = (4, 3, 4). (39) The Euclidean space R n Vectors on R n (iv) Area of parallelogram by b and c=∥b × c∥ = √ 16 + 9 + 16 = √ 41. (v) Triple product: a · (b × c) = (0, 3, 4) · (4, 3, 4) = 9 + 16 = 25. (40) (vi) Volume of parallelepiped= |a · (b × c)| = 25. Note that this solid has edges O, A, B, C and the end points of the vectors a + b, b + c, c + a and a + b + c.

(44) the H0 is mostly referred as a double cone. The Euclidean space R n More surfaces on R 3 Cone The standard cone is given by the equation z = √x 2 + y 2. (45)","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
