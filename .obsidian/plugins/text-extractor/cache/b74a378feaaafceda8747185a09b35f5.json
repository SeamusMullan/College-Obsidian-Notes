Introduction to Probability Example Toss a coin, get a H or T . Since H and T are equally likely, we write P(H) = P(T ) = 1/2 Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 1.1 Experiments, sample spaces and events Formal terminology: Experiment: procedure where the result cannot be known in advance. E.g. Toss a coin, observe the result. Sample space: Set of all outcomes, denoted by Ω. E.g. Ω = {H, T } Event: Any subset of Ω. E.g. Event that we get T . Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example Experiment: roll a die. 1 List the outcomes in the sample space. 2 List the outcomes that makeup the following events: A = event an even number is obtained, B = event that a number greater than 4 is obtained. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example: Write out the sample space for the following experiments: 1 Toss a coin twice, observe the result. 2 Toss a coin twice, count the number of heads. 3 Toss a coin twice, observe whether the two tosses are the same. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Note: Sample spaces may be discrete or continuous. A sample space is discrete if it is finite or countable i.e. the elements can be listed even if it is an infinite list. In a continuous sample space there are no ‘gaps’ between the elements and the elements cannot be listed. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 1.2 Complements, unions and intersections Definitions: Complement: A c = event that A does not occur. Union: A ∪ B = event that A and/or B occurs. Intersection: A ∩ B = event that both A and B occur. Venn diagram examples Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example: Back to the roll a die example. Recap: A = event an even number is obtained, B = event that a number greater than 4 is obtained. List the outcomes in: 1 A c 2 A ∪ B 3 A ∩ B Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Note: For events A, B and C, the following hold: commutative laws: A ∪ B = B ∪ A A ∩ B = B ∩ A associative laws: (A ∪ B) ∪ C = A ∪ (B ∪ C ) (A ∩ B) ∩ C = A ∩ (B ∩ C ) distributive laws: A ∪ (B ∩ C ) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C ) A ∩ (B ∪ C ) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C ) Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 1.3 Probability when all outcomes are equally likely When all outcomes in Ω are equally likely: P(event) = # of outcomes in the event # of outcomes in Ω Example: Back to the roll a die example. Recap: A = event an even number is obtained, B = event that a number greater than 4 is obtained. Find: 1 P(A) 2 P(B) 3 P(A ∪ B) 4 P(A ∩ B) 5 P(B c ) Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example 3 letters addressed to Tom, Dick and Harry are randomly placed in three envelopes addressed to Tom, Dick and Harry. List the outcomes in the sample space and find the probability that everyone gets the right letter. Answer: If lowercase denotes the letter and order is the envelope: Ω = {tdh,thd, hdt, htd, dht, dth} Sample space has 6 equally likely outcomes, so P(tdh) = 1/6. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example contd. Find the probability that: 1 Tom gets the right letter 2 Exactly one person gets the right letter 3 Someone gets the right letter 4 No one gets the right letter Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example A family has three children. Assume that the probability of a boy and of a girl is 0.5. 1 List the outcomes in the sample space. 2 What is the probability that all three children are girls? 3 What is the probability that they have two girls and one boy? 4 What is the probability of at least one girl? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 1.4 Probability function Example: Suppose in a college we can break down the student population into the following groups: female male arts 30% 30% not arts 25% 15% Experiment: One student is randomly selected. Let: F = event that the selected student is female A = event that the selected student studies arts. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 1.4 Probability function Example contd. female male arts 30% 30% not arts 25% 15% Find: 1 P(F ) 2 P(F c ) 3 P(A) 4 P(Ac ) 5 P(F ∩ A) 6 P(F c ∩ A) 7 P(F ∪ A) Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics What is P, the probability function? In an applied sense, this is a measure of the likelihood or chance that something will happen, e.g. that a (random) event will occur. When dealing with experiments that are random and well-defined, one can consider probability to be the relative frequency ‘in the long run’ of outcomes. E.g. Tossing a coin - repeat the experiment infinitely many times. Axiomatic definition: there are rules that tell us what is a valid probability function. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Axioms of probability 1 For any event A, 0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1. i.e. probability must be between 0 and 1. 2 Let a = outcome, A = event. Then P(A) = ∑ a∈A P(a). i.e. probability of event A is the sum of the probabilities of all outcomes in A. 3 P(Ω) = ∑ a∈Ω P(a) = 1 i.e. the sum of the probabilities of all outcomes must be 1. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example: Suppose there are 4 possible outcomes to an experiment, i.e. Ω = {a1, a2, a3, a4}. We are told P(a1) = P(a2) = 0.2, P(a3) = 0.5. What is P(a4)? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example: Suppose there are 4 possible outcomes to an experiment, i.e. Ω = {a1, a2, a3, a4}. We are told P(a1) = P(a2) = 0.2, P(a3) = P(a4) = 0.5. These are invalid assignments! Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 1.5 Probability for complement, union and intersection All outcomes belong to A or A c . Therefore: P(A c ) = P(Ω) − P(A) = 1 − P(A). Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics A ∪ B is composed of outcomes in A or B or both. P(A) + P(B) counts the events that are in both A and B twice. So: P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A ∩ B). Q: P(A c ∩ B c )=? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example: A house needs to be re-roofed for spring. To do this, a dry windless day is needed. The probability of getting a dry day is 0.7, a windy day is 0.4 and a wet and windy day is 0.2. On a randomly selected day, what is the probability that the house can be re-roofed? Answer: Experiment: weather on a randomly selected day. Let D denote the event that the randomly selected day is dry and W that it is windy. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 1.6 Sampling problems Sampling can happen with or without replacement. Sampling without replacement Example A box has 5 tickets labelled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Suppose that 2 tickets are sampled without replacement. The outcomes are: (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (2,1) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (3,1) (3,2) (3,4) (3,5) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,5) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) There are 20 equally likely outcomes. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example contd. 1 What is the probability of a 3 followed by a 4? 2 What is the probability of a 3, 4 in any order? If we do not keep track of the order in which the tickets are sampled there are 10 unordered outcomes, each of which are equally likely. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics In general, if a box has n tickets and a sample of size k is taken without replacement, then there are C n k = (n k ) = n! k!(n − k)! = n(n − 1)...(n − k + 1) k! equally likely unordered outcomes and P n k = (n k ) k! = n! (n − k)! = n(n − 1)...(n − k + 1) equally likely ordered outcomes. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Sampling with replacement Example A box has 5 tickets labelled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Suppose that 2 tickets are sampled with replacement. The outcomes are: (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) There are 25 possible ordered outcomes each of which are equally likely. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example contd. 1 What is the probability of a 3 followed by a 4? 2 What is the probability of a 3, 4 in any order? If we do not keep track of the order in which the tickets are sampled there are 15 unordered outcomes, each of which are NOT equally likely. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics In general, if a box has n tickets and a sample of size k is taken with replacement, then there are nk equally likely ordered outcomes and there are (n + k − 1 k ) unordered outcomes which are not equally likely. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example Suppose a box has 100 chips of which 10 are defective. If 4 chips are selected at random from the box: 1 What is the probability that the sample has no defectives? 2 What is the probability that there are exactly 2 defectives in the sample? Answer We can think of the chips as being numbered 1,...,100 where 1,...,10 are defective and 11,...,100 are okay. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example Suppose 5 cards are dealt at random from a well-shuffled deck of 52 cards. Note: The hand can be thought of as a random sample of size 5 from 52 with no replacement. Compute the following probabilities. 1 P(4 aces) 2 P(3 aces and 2 kings) 3 P(4 of a kind) Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example Suppose you buy a lotto ticket. Assume 6 numbers drawn without replacement from 1,...,45. 1 What is the probability of winning the jackpot? 2 What is the probability of winning if you buy two tickets? 3 What is the probability of matching 5 of the 6 numbers? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example The Birthday Problem. In a room of 30 students, what is the probability that at least two people share a birthday? 1 How many possibilities are there for the birthdays for the 30 students? 2 How many possibilities are there if no two students share a birthday? 3 P(no matching birthday)? 4 P(at least two people matching)? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Additional notes on permutations 1 As we know already, the number of k-element permutations of a set containing n objects is given by P n k = n! (n − k)! If k = n this becomes P n n = n! (n − n)! = n! 0! = n! 2 The number of distinguishable permutations of n objects of r different types, where n1 are alike, n2 are alike,..., nr are alike and n = n1 + ... + nr is n! n1!n2!...nr ! Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example In how many ways can we paint 11 offices so that four of them will be painted green, three yellow, two white and the remaining two pink? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 1.7 Independent events Definition: Two events A and B are independent if P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B). Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example: A card is drawn at random from a 52 card deck. Let: A = event card is an ace, B = event card is a diamond. Are A and B independent? Answer: Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example: A box has 3 red and 2 black balls. Two are drawn at random without replacement. Let: A = event 1st ball is red, B = event 2nd ball is red. Are A and B independent? Answer: Suppose balls are numbered 1 to 5. The first three are red. We list ordered outcomes since the events A and B distinguish first and second draw. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example contd. There are 5 × 4 = 20 equally likely ordered outcomes. Ω = { (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)} Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example: If the two balls are drawn with replacement, there are 5 × 5 = 25 equally likely ordered outcomes. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 1.8 Conditional probability Definition: Given two events A and B, the conditional probability of A given B is defined as P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) P(B) . Therefore: P(A ∩ B) = P(A|B)P(B) = P(B|A)P(A). Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example: Back to the student example female male arts 30% 30% not arts 25% 15% A random student is selected. Let: F = event that the selected student is female. A = event that the selected student studies arts. Then: P(F ) = 0.55 P(A) = 0.6 P(F ∩ A) = 0.3 Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Probability tree diagram Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Questions: A student is chosen at random. 1 If the student studies arts, what is the probability that they are female? 2 If the student is female, what is the probability that they study arts? 3 If the student is female, what is the probability that they don’t study arts? 4 If the student is male, what is the probability that they study arts? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Definition: Two events A and B are independent if P(A|B) = P(A). i.e. knowing B has occurred does not change the probability of A. Back to the student example: Are the events F and A independent? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Note: If A and B are independent, then Ac and B are independent and A c and B c are independent. Proof: If A and B are independent then: P(A|B) = P(A) 1 − P(A|B) = 1 − P(A) P(Ac |B) = P(Ac ) ⇒ A c and B are independent. Then: P(B|A c ) = P(B) 1 − P(B|A c ) = 1 − P(B) P(B c |A c ) = P(B c ) ⇒ A c and B c are independent. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics The Multiplicative Rule If A and B are independent, then P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B) The General Multiplicative Rule In general, P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B|A) or P(A ∩ B) = P(B)P(A|B) This general rule does not require A and B to be independent. But remember that if A and B are independent, then P(B|A) = P(B) and P(A|B) = P(A). Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 1.9 Mutually exclusive events Definition: Two events A and B are mutually exclusive, or disjoint, if A ∩ B = ∅. Venn diagram: Does this mean A and B are independent? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Definition: A partition of the sample space Ω is a collection of mutually exclusive events whose union is Ω. Any set or event can be partitioned. Definition: If B1, ..., Bk form a partition of Ω, then A ∩ B1, ..., A ∩ Bk form a partition of A. The partition theorem: Let B1, ..., Bk form a partition of Ω. Then for any event A: P(A) = k∑ i=1 P(A ∩ Bi ) Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example: In a survey: 13% of respondents had children and had a large car 12% of respondents did not have children and had a large car Find the probability that a respondent picked at random had a large car. Answer: Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example In a game show, there are 3 doors, behind two doors are goats and behind the other door is a car. You as the contestant pick and door and announce your choice but the door remains closed. The host (who knows where the car is) opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat. You can stick with your original choice or switch to the other closed door. Question: Should you stick or switch?

Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 1.10 Bayes Theorem From the definition of conditional probability, we can derive: P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|Ac )P(Ac ) This result is known as the Bayes theorem.

What is the probability that a randomly selected colourblind person from this population is male? Answer: Let: M = event randomly selected person is male C = event randomly selected person is colourblind. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example: A disease infects 1 out of 1000 people. There is a test (not perfect, if a person has the disease, the test comes back positive 99% of the time, but gives 2% of false positives). You tested positive. What are the chances you actually have the disease? Answer: Let: D = event you have the disease T = event you tested positive Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 1 Probability – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example Travelling by train with sister – without tickets!
