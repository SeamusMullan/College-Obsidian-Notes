Assume that the probability of a boy and of a girl is 0.5. We have seen the sample space for this experiment before. Let X be the random variable defined as the \"total number of boys\" and Y equal to 1 if the firstborn is female and 0 otherwise.

Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 4 Bivariate discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 4.2 Marginal and Conditional Distributions The marginal distributions of X and Y can be obtained from the joint distribution: P(X = x) = ∑ y P(X = x, Y = y ) P(Y = y ) = ∑ x P(X = x, Y = y ) e.g. P(X = 0) = ∑ x P(X = 0, Y = y ) = P(X = 0, Y = 0) + P(X = 0, Y = 1) = 0 + 1/8 = 1/8 Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 4 Bivariate discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Y X P(Y = y ) 0 1 2 3 0 0 1/8 2/8 1/8 1/2 1 1/8 2/8 1/8 0 1/2 P(X = x) 1/8 3/8 3/8 1/8 The expected values for X and Y , as well as their variances are computed the same way we have learned before, using their marginal distributions. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 4 Bivariate discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics The conditional distribution of X |Y = y is P(X = x|Y = y ) = P(X = x, Y = y ) P(Y = y ) e.g. P(X = 0|Y = 0) = P(X = 0, Y = 0) P(Y = 0) = 0 1/2 = 0 P(X = 1|Y = 0) = P(X = 1, Y = 0) P(Y = 0) = 1/8 1/2 = 1/4 P(X = 2|Y = 0) = P(X = 2, Y = 0) P(Y = 0) = 2/8 1/2 = 1/2 P(X = 3|Y = 0) = P(X = 3, Y = 0) P(Y = 0) = 1/8 1/2 = 1/4 Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 4 Bivariate discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 1 Find the conditional distribution of X |Y = 1. 2 Find the conditional distribution of Y |X = 2. 3 Find the conditional distribution of Y |X = 3. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 4 Bivariate discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 4.3 Covariance between two discrete random variables The covariance between random variables X and Y is defined as Cov(X , Y ) = E[XY ] − E[X ]E[Y ] The covariance can be any real value. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 4 Bivariate discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics In our example, E[XY ] = ∑ x ∑ y xy P(X = x, Y = y ) = 0 × 0 × P(X = 0, Y = 0) + 0 × 1 × P(X = 0, Y = 1) + 1 × 0 × P(X = 1, Y = 0) + 1 × 1 × P(X = 1, Y = 1) + 2 × 0 × P(X = 2, Y = 0) + 2 × 1 × P(X = 2, Y = 1) + 3 × 0 × P(X = 3, Y = 0) + 3 × 1 × P(X = 3, Y = 1) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 2/8 + 0 + 2/8 + 0 + 0 = 1/2 Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 4 Bivariate discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics So we have Cov(X , Y ) = 1 2 − 3 2 × 1 2 = − 1 4 Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 4 Bivariate discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Exercise: Take the joint p.m.f. of X and Y given by Y X 0 1 2 1 3/20 3/20 2/20 2 1/20 1/20 2/20 3 4/20 1/20 3/20 Compute Cov(X , Y ). Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 4 Bivariate discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 4.4 Correlation between two discrete random variables The correlation coefficient ρXY is given by ρXY = Cov(X , Y ) √ Var(X )Var(Y ) We can show that −1 ≤ ρXY ≤ 1. In our example: ρXY = −1/4 √3/4 × 1/4 = − √ 3 3 = −0.5774 If X and Y are independent, then Cov(X , Y ) = 0 (and hence ρXY = 0 as well), however a covariance of zero does not imply independence. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 4 Bivariate discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 4.5 Independence X and Y are independent if P(X = x, Y = y ) = P(X = x)P(Y = y ) Are X and Y independent in the children example? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 4 Bivariate discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Exercise: Check if X and Y are independent if their joint p.m.f. is given by: Y X 0 1 0 1/16 3/16 1 2/16 3/8 2 1/16 3/16 Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 4 Bivariate discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Exercise: Check if X and Y are independent if their joint p.m.f. is given by: Y X −1 0 1 −1 1/8 1/8 1/8 0 1/8 0 1/8 1 1/8 1/8 1/8 Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 4 Bivariate discrete random variables – ST221 Introduction to Statistics","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
