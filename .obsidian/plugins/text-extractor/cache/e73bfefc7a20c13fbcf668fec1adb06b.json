{"path":"Year 2/Semester 1/Statistics/Extra Materials/E7Normalcurve.pdf","text":"Department of Mathematics ST221: Introduction to Statistics Dr David Redmond Some examples using the Standard Normal Tables: This shaded area shows P (0 < Z < 1.31) = 0.4049, which obtained from the Stan- dard Normal Table. This shaded area shows P (Z < 1.31) = 0.5 + 0.4049, which is obtained by adding 0.5 to previous answer. This shaded area shows P (Z > 1.31) = 0.5 − 0.4049, which obtained subtracting the ﬁrst answer from 0.5. This shaded area shows P (−1.31 < Z < 0) = 0.4049, which by symmetry equals the ﬁrst answer. This shaded area shows P (Z > −1.31) = 0.5 + 0.4049, which, by symmetry, equals the second answer. This shaded area shows P (−1.31 < Z < 1.72) = P (−1.31 < Z < 0) + P (0 < Z < 1.72) = 0.4049 + 0.4573. The answer is obtained by adding the areas to the left and right of the y−axis. This shaded area shows P (Z < −1.31) = 0.5 − 0.4049, which, by symmetry, equals the third answer. This shaded area shows P (1.31 < Z < 1.72) = P (0 < Z < 1.72) − P (0 < Z < 1.31) = 0.4573 − 0.4049. The answer is obtained by subtracting the two relevant areas","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
