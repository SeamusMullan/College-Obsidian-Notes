Determine: · possible values X can take: e.g. x = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10, x ∈ (0, 1), etc · probability mass function p(x) = P(X = x), or probability density function f (x). Note: so far we have assumed that the distribution and parameters are known. From now on, we use data to estimate the parameters of some assumed distribution. In this section we will examine continuous data and in the next section categorical data. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics The general idea: We have some data (e.g. X1 = x1, ..., Xn = xn) and want to ask some questions about the population the data came from. We assume the observations are random draws from some distribution where E (Xi ) = µ, Var (Xi ) = σ2. We use the data to estimate µ and σ2. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Population versus sample. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Terminology: Population parameters: E (X ) = µ, Var (X ) = σ2. Sample statistics: ¯X = n∑ i=1 Xi n S 2 = n∑ i=1 (Xi − ¯X )2 n − 1 In the classical framework: Parameters µ, σ2 are some fixed, but unknown values that we would like to estimate from our data. Statistics ¯X , S 2 are random variables. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Terminology: Population parameters: E (X ) = µ, Var (X ) = σ2. Sample statistics: ¯X = n∑ i=1 Xi n S 2 = n∑ i=1 (Xi − ¯X )2 n − 1 In the classical framework: Parameters µ, σ2 are some fixed, but unknown values that we would like to estimate from our data. Statistics ¯X , S 2 are random variables. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 6.1 Estimation and confidence intervals for large samples Estimation Example: a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association examined whether the true mean body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. The study gave 130 readings of body temperature for 65 women and 65 men. The sample mean of these 130 readings was 98.249 and sample standard deviation 0.733. ¯x = 98.249, s = 0.733, n = 130. Question: What is µ the population mean human body temperature? Answer: Suppose the data represent a random sample from the population of all body temperatures. Then we would estimate the population mean µ by the sample mean ¯x, i.e. we estimate the mean human body temperature to be 98.249. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Reliability of the estimate of µ E xample (human body temperature) contd. We have estimated that the mean human body temperature is 98.249. But how reliable is this estimate? If we repeated the study we would most likely get a different answer. But how different? We use the information about the variability of the data and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to answer that question. Suppose that the population has a standard deviation of σ. Our estimate of σ is the sample standard deviation s, which is 0.733. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Constructing the CI for µ Estimate of µ: ¯x = 98.249, estimate of σ: s = 0.733. From the Central Limit Theorem: ¯X ∼ N(µ, σ2 n ) approximately for large n. Using s 2 to estimate σ2: ¯X ∼ approx N(µ, s 2 n ) ¯X ∼ approx N(µ, 0.733 2 130 ) ¯X − µ s/√n ∼ approx N(0, 1) Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics The quantity s√ n is called the standard error of ¯X and we write SE ( ¯X ). For the temperature data SE ( ¯X ) = s√ n = 0.733√ 130 = 0.064. FACT: 95% of the area under the N(0, 1) curve lies in ±1.96 (CHECK TABLES!). Or we can say P(−1.96 < z < 1.96) = 0.95 Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics What does this mean? P(−1.96 < z < 1.96) = 0.95 Therefore, P(−1.96 < ¯X − µ s/√ n < 1.96) = 0.95 And, P( ¯X − 1.96 s √ n < µ < ¯X + 1.96 s √n ) = 0.95 i.e. with probability 0.95 µ is contained in ¯X ± 1.96 s √ n which is called a 95% confidence interval for µ. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example contd. (Human body temperature) ¯x ± 1.96 × s √ n = 98.249 ± 1.96 × 0.064 = (98.12, 98.38) Interpretation: with 95% confidence, the true mean human body temperature is between 98.12 and 98.38. Question: Is the true population mean really 98.6? Answer: 98.6 is well outside of the 95% confidence interval, so it is very unlikely to be the true value of µ. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics CI for large samples - general format. In general, if we have a random sample of observations from a population we can estimate the population mean µ using ¯x and if n is sufficiently large (usually n ≥ 30) we can construct a 100(1 − α)% confidence interval for the population mean µ using the formula ¯x ± zα/2 s √ n where zα/2 can be read from the tables. Will µ be in the confidence interval? Will ¯x be in the confidence interval? We say that we are 100(1 − α)% confident that µ, the population mean will be in the interval. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example. Engineers from a motor company have developed a new type of break light for motor vehicles. As part of the safety evaluation program the company wished to estimate the mean drive response time to the new brake light. Fifty drivers were selected at random and the response time (in seconds) was recorded for each. The sample mean was 0.72 and the sample variance was 0.022. Estimate a 99% confidence interval for the mean driver response time to the new brake light. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Summary of estimation and confidence intervals for large samples Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 6.2 Estimation and confidence intervals for small samples Estimation Example: A pharmaceutical company has developed a drug they believe will help cure a particular disease and has acquired legal permission to test the drug on humans. However, there are safety concerns that the drug will have an adverse effect on blood pressure. They run an experiment to estimate the average increase in blood pressure for patients who take the new drug. They only have permission to test the drug on ten patients. The ten recordings are 1.3, 2, 2.4, 1.1, 1.4, 3.2, 3.4, 2.4, 2.7, 3.1. ¯x = 2.3, s = 0.82865, n = 10. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example contd. Question: What is µ the population mean increase in blood pressure for people who take the drug? Answer: Suppose the data represent a random sample from the population of all people who take the drug. Then we would estimate the population mean µ by the sample mean ¯x, i.e. we estimate the mean increase in blood pressure to be 2.3. Estimating the mean for a small sample is the same as for a large sample. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Reliability of the estimate of µ When we have a large enough sample, we rely on the Central Limit Theorem to tell us that: ¯X − µ s/√ n ∼ approx N(0, 1) regardless of what distribution the population has. If we have a small sample, we cannot make this assumption. However, in the case of small samples, if we know that the population the sample comes from is normal or approximately normal, then we can assume ¯X − µ s/√ n ∼ t(n−1) where t(n−1) denotes the t-distribution with ν = n − 1 degrees of freedom. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics More about the t distribution t density curve is symmetric about 0 and bell shaped. only one parameter: degrees of freedom (ν). the density curve is flatter than N(0,1) ν controls how spread out the distribution is, i.e. how flat the density curve is. As ν increases, the t-density curve approaches the N(0,1) curve and the tν ≈ N(0, 1) curve for ν ≥ 30. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Constructing the CI for µ Therefore, if n is small we use the t-distribution to construct CIs: P(−t(ν, α 2 ) < ¯X − µ s/√ n < t(ν, α 2 )) = 1 − α so, P( ¯X − t(ν, α 2 ) s √n < µ < ¯X + t(ν, α 2 ) s √n ) = 1 − α giving the interval, ¯X ± t(ν, α 2 )SE ( ¯X ) where we read t(ν, α 2 ) from the t-tables. However, before constructing the CI, we should draw a histogram (or some other graphic) of the raw data to see if it follows a normal or approximately normal distribution. (This is not necessary if the sample is large enough because of the CLT.) Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Note on the t-tables In standard normal tables, probabilities for a single density curve N(0, 1) are tabulated, while in Student’s t tables critical values for 30 density curves tν , ν = 1, ..., 30 are tabulated. In the t tables, the first column contains ν i.e. the degrees of freedom and the first row denotes the probabilities (P(X > t(ν, α 2 )) = α/2). The corresponding critical values (t(ν, α 2 )) are in the body of the table. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example (pharmaceutical) contd. Do the data look roughly normal? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Degrees of freedom = ν = n − 1 = 10 − 1 = 9 From the tables, 95% of the area under the t9 curve lies between ±2.262. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Constructing the confidence interval: The 95% confidence interval is given by ¯x ± tν, 0.05 2 SE (¯x) ⇒ 2.3 ± 2.262 0.82865 √10 = 2.3 ± 2.262 × 0.26204 = (1.707, 2.893) Interpretation: We are 95% confident that the population mean increase in blood pressure for people on the drug is between 1.707 and 2.893. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Additional thoughts: Question: Is the true population mean equal to 0? Answer: 0 is not in the 95% CI so it is not a plausible value for µ. The CI supports the claim that the drug has an adverse effect on blood pressure. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example Pulse rate is an important measure of the fitness of a person’s cardiovascular system. The mean pulse rate for adult males is approximately 72 heart beats per minute. A random sample of 21 males who jog at least 10 kilometres per week had a mean pulse rate of 52.6 beats per minute and a standard deviation of 3.22 beats per minute. A histogram of the data was unimodal and symmetric. Construct a 90% confidence interval for the mean pulse rate of all adult males who jog at least 10 km per week. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Examples for small and large samples Example Data: 4, 7, 16, 12, 9, 8, 7, 6, 6, 11, 3, 19, 8, 7, 10, 7, 9, 6, 6, 13, 12, 16, 14, 7, 5, 5, 3, 8, 11, 15, 16, 11, 10. Construct a 99% CI for µ. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example Data: 13, 19, 21, 24, 18, 17, 24, 19, 16, 22, 26, 19. Construct a 95% CI for µ. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 6.3 Hypothesis testing The general idea: We have some hypothesis or theory about a population. We collect some data and use it to assess the truth of the hypothesis. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example (blood pressure for people on a particular drug) Is µ the true mean change in blood pressure for people on the drug equal to 0? Our null hypothesis is that the true mean change in blood pressure for people on the drug is equal to 0. However, it is suspected that the true mean change in blood pressure is greater than 0. This is our alternative hypothesis. From these n = 10 observations we calculate the (sample) mean ¯x = 2.3 and the (sample) standard deviation s = 0.82865. ¯x > 0 but can we conclude that µ > 0? Imagine that the population mean µ = 0. Once we collect a sample and calculate its sample mean, we are unlikely to get exactly ¯x = 0. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Some definitions: The null hypothesis H0 represents the statement being tested. In other words, this is a hypothesis we want to disprove. The alternative hypothesis HA is what we suspect is true, i.e. what we want to establish. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example (blood pressure) contd In this example, under our null hypothesis µ = µ0 = 0 and we write: H0 : µ = 0 versus HA : µ > 0. Note: this alternative hypothesis is one-sided. If we suspected that the mean change in blood pressure µ is less than 0, we would write: H0 : µ = 0 versus HA : µ < 0. Note: this is also a one-sided alternative hypothesis. We could also have: H0 : µ = 0 versus HA : µ ̸= 0. which is a two-sided hypothesis. In this case we have no prior belief for what µ should be, we just suspect it is not 0. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Deciding on the hypotheses We decide on our hypotheses before we see our data. The choice depends on the context. If you’re unsure which hypothesis is appropriate, use the two sided alternative. In the context of testing a hypothesis about the population mean, the null hypothesis always has the form H0 : µ = µ0 The alternative hypothesis can take any of the following forms: HA : µ ̸= µ0 HA : µ > µ0 HA : µ < µ0 Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Test Statistic A test statistic is used to compare the observed data with the null hypothesis H0. For testing hypotheses about µ the appropriate test statistic is: T = ¯X − µ0 s/√ n . If the null hypothesis is true (i.e. µ = µ0 is correct): When n > 30, T ∼ N(0, 1) approximately. When n ≤ 30, T ∼ tn−1. In the case of n ≤ 30, we assume that the population the sample came from is normally (or approximately normally) distributed. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example (blood pressure) contd. H0 : µ = 0 versus HA : µ > 0. I.e. µ0 = 0 The observed test statistic is: Tobs = 2.3 − 0 0.82865/√10 = 8.78 Does the data support the null hypothesis? Based on the observed test statistic we either: Reject the null hypothesis and accept that the alternative hypothesis is true. Or, fail to reject the null hypothesis and have no evidence that the alternative hypothesis is true. To decide which of these happens we compute the p-value. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example (blood pressure) contd. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics What is a P-value? A p-value is the probability of observing the test statistic or a more extreme test statistic, given that the null hypothesis is true. Two-sided alternative: H0 : µ = 0 versus HA : µ ̸= 0 P-value = 2P(tn−1 ≥ |Tobs |). One-sided alternative: H0 : µ = 0 versus HA : µ < 0 P-value = P(tn−1 ≤ Tobs ). One-sided alternative: H0 : µ = 0 versus HA : µ > 0 P-value = P(tn−1 ≥ Tobs ). If the P-value is very small, then our observed statistic is very extreme and H0 is unlikely to be true. But what is ‘very small’ ? Fix a significance level α. If the P-value is less than α then we reject H0 at level α. Otherwise we fail to reject H0. Use the significance level α = 0.05 unless told otherwise. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example (blood pressure) contd. Here, One-sided alternative: H0 : µ = 0 versus HA : µ > 0 We have observed Tobs = 8.78. P-value = P(tn−1 ≥ Tobs ) = P(t9 ≥ 8.78). We compute our p-value: P(t9 ≥ 1.83) = 0.05 and since 8.78 > 1.83, we know that P(t9 ≥ 8.78) < 0.05. Conclusion: We reject the null hypothesis and conclude that µ > 0. NB: In the case that we fail to reject the null hypothesis that does not mean that we have proven that it is true. Just that we have no evidence for the alternative. We therefore do not say that we accept the null hypothesis. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example (blood pressure) contd. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Additional examples of computing a p-value Example H0 : µ = µ0, HA : µ > µ0, n = 15 Tobs = 0.75 P-value Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example H0 : µ = µ0, HA : µ < µ0, n = 54 Tobs = -2.73 P-value Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example H0 : µ = µ0, HA : µ ̸= µ0, n = 18 Tobs = 1.5 P-value Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Steps in a hypothesis test If the sample size is below 30, we first need to be sure that the sample comes from an approximately normally distributed population. If the sample size is large enough, the CLT tells us about the sampling distribution of the mean, regardless of the underlying distribution of the population. The steps are: 1 Set up the null and alternative hypotheses 2 Compute the test statistic 3 Compute the P-value 4 State conclusions Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example A lab is asked to analyze some vitamin tablets to check if the active ingredient has a mean concentration of 0.86. The lab tests 35 tablets. They find that the mean concentration is 0.8404 with a standard deviation of 0.05. What can you conclude from this? Let µ be the mean concentration in the population of tablets. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example When designing a cinema, engineers consider the ’sitting eye’ heights of the audience. A random sample of the eye sitting height (in mm) of 20 men at a cinema was recorded. The summary statistics are ¯x = 787.95 and s = 30.35. Is there evidence that the mean sitting eye height is above 750? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 6.4 Comparing two independent samples So far, we have looked at inference for a population mean based on a sample. Suppose we have two samples from two different populations and we want to compare them. Data x1, x2, ..., xn are random sample from the first population and data y1, y2, ..., ym are a random sample from the second population. The samples are independent. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example The heights of a group of children all age 10 were recorded. Assume these represent independent random samples from populations of all 10 year old girls and boys. Let the first population have mean µX and variance σ2. Let the second population have mean µY and variance σ2. The data from the experiment are: Heights of girls: 51.2, 51.7, 53.2, 54.2, 54.3, 55.1, 56.7, 56.8, 57.2, 60.5 Heights of boys: 51.0, 52.7, 53.8, 53.8, 54.0, 54.6, 56.0. We get the summary statistics: Girls: ¯x = 55.09, sX = 2.80573 n = 10 Boys: ¯y = 53.7, sY = 1.55456, m = 7. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example Heights data contd. ● ● Boys Girls5254565860 GenderHeight (inches) Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Estimation How do we estimate the difference between µX and µY the means for each population? We estimate µX by the sample mean ¯x and we estimate µY by the sample mean ¯y . It follows that ¯x − ¯y is an estimate for µX - µY . How do we estimate the variance σ2? Remember that we have assumed that both populations have the same variance σ2. We can estimate this from either sX and sY . However, it would be better to use both to estimate σ2. We ‘pool’ these two statistics into an overall estimate of σ2: s 2 p = (n − 1)s 2 X + (m − 1)s 2 Y n + m − 2 . Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Confidence interval for the difference between two means A confidence interval for µX − µY is given by (¯x − ¯y ) ± t(ν, α 2 ) × SE The SE is the standard error (remember for the one-sample CI this was s/ √n). Here the SE( ¯X − ¯Y ) is sp √ 1 n + 1 m where sp is the pooled estimate of σ. t(ν, α 2 ) depends of the confidence level and the degrees of freedom which are given by df=n + m − 2. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example (heights of 10 year olds) contd. Back to our data, we had: Girls: ¯x = 55.09, sX = 2.80573 n = 10 Boys: ¯y = 53.7, sY = 1.55456, m = 7. s 2 p = 5.6899 and sp = 2.3854, df = 10+7-2=15. To construct a 95% CI for µX − µY : (¯x − ¯y ) ± t(ν, α 2 ) × SE = (−1.1, 3.9). Interpretation: We are 95% confident that in the population of 10 year olds, the average height for girls is between 1.1 inches shorter to 3.9 inches taller than the average height for boys. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example (heights of 10 year olds) contd. In this example, we have made the following assumptions: Both populations have the same variance Both populations are normal. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Hypothesis test to compare two populations The steps are the same as before: 1 Set up the null and alternative hypotheses 2 Compute the test statistic 3 Compute the P-value 4 State conclusions In general in hypothesis testing, the test statistic is of the form: Tobs = estimate - parameter value under null hypothesis SE Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example (heights of 10 year olds) contd. Following the steps: 1 If our goal is to establish that ten year old girls are taller, we write: H0 : µX − µY = 0 vs HA : µX − µY > 0. 2 The observed test statistic is: Tobs = ¯x − ¯y − (0) SE = 1.39/1.1755 = 1.18 3 P-value = P(t15 ≥ 1.18) > 0.05. Since: P(t15 ≥ 1.753) = 0.05. 4 Since P-value > 0.05 we fail to reject H0. There is no evidence that the population mean heights of 10 year olds girls is larger than for boys. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example An experiment compared the effects of two growth hormones on the weight gain of pregnant rats. Weight gains are recorded for 20 rats receiving hormone A and 20 receiving hormone B. The data are summarized as: A: ¯x = 51.8, sx = 10.6, B: ¯y = 60.2, sy = 16.4. Test the appropriate hypothesis and give the 95% CI for the mean difference in weight gain between the treatment populations. The hypothesis test: Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example contd. The confidence interval: Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 6.5 Comparing two dependent samples Two samples with paired data Up to now we have assumed that the two samples are independent of each other. What if this is not the case? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example Does medication M reduce the blood pressure of the user? An experiment was carried out to test this. The blood pressures of 15 women were recorded prior to starting the treatment. The data is: x1, x2, ..., x15. After taking the medication M for 6 months their blood pressure was recorded again. The new data is: y1, y2, ..., y15. Here the x and y samples are not independent, because we have two measurements on each person. We cannot use the methods for two independent samples. Method: calculate differences di = xi − yi . Thus our new data is: d1, d2, ..., d15. Analyse these using one sample methods. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example Do self reported (SR) and measured (M) heights differ? A study of 12 males aged 12-16 asked them for a self assessment of their height and also measured the height in inches. The results are: SR 68 71 63 70 71 60 65 64 54 63 66 72 M 67.9 69.9 64.9 68.3 70.3 60.6 65.5 67.0 55.6 74.2 65.0 70.8 Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics 6.6 Statistical inference for categorical responses In the previous sections we looked at tests for continuous data for single variables (e.g. the weight of a person) and also compared continuous data for two groups (e.g. comparison of weights for males and females). In this section we will examine categorical variables with 2 categories or levels. Examples of categorical data (where k is the number of categories or levels): Gender: male or female (k=2) Drink alcohol: a lot, a little, not at all (k=3) Cause of death: heart disease, cancer, accident, other (k=4). When the number of levels is two, we call this a binary variable. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics A single binary variable Example 500 people chosen at random were surveyed and 315 supported a government policy on a particular austerity measure. Here, each person answers either yes or no, so k=2. Let X be the number of people in the sample who answered yes. Prior to collecting the data, we know that X ∼ Binomial(n, p), where n = sample size and p = probability that a person says yes. p is the proportion of the population that supports the policy. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Generally we don’t know p but it is something that we would like to know and this is often the motivation for carrying out the survey in the first place. Estimation We can estimate p from the data: ˆp = x n In our example, ˆp = 315 500 = 0.63. So we estimate that 63% of the population supports the government policy. But how reliable is this estimate? NB: What is the difference between p and ˆp? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Reliability of the estimate of p We can construct a confidence interval for p. Recall: X ∼ Binomial(n, p) ≈ N(np, np(1 − p)) for large n. Therefore, X ∼ approx N(np, np(1 − p)) So, X − np √np(1 − p) ∼ approx N(0, 1) So, ˆp − p √ p(1 − p)/n ∼ approx N(0, 1) Since we don’t know p, we use SE ( ˆp) = √ ˆp(1 − ˆp) n and ˆp − p SE ( ˆp) ∼ approx N(0, 1) for large n. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Confidence interval for p When n is large, we get a 100(1-α)% CI for p using: ˆp ± z α 2 SE ( ˆp) I.e., ˆp ± z α 2 √ ˆp(1 − ˆp) n Assumptions for the interval to be valid: Need the sample to be a simple random sample from a large population. Need both the expected number of ‘successes’ and ‘failures’ to be at least 10. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example contd. (government policy) Interpretation Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Hypothesis testing for p In general we have: H0: p = p0 versus HA: p ̸= p0 or HA: p > p0 or HA: p < p0 Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics For the confidence interval, we computed SE ( ˆp) = √ ˆp(1− ˆp) n , however, for the hypothesis test we construct our test statistic assuming that the H0 is true and so we use √ p0(1 − p0) n as the denominator of our test. To test a population proportion, the test statistic therefore is: z = ˆp − p0 √ p0(1−p0) n ∼ approx N(0, 1) under H0 Assumptions (as before): Need the sample to be a simple random sample from a large population. Need both the expected number of ‘successes’ and ‘failures’ to be at least 10. Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University 6 Statistical Inference – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Example contd. (government policy) The government want to establish whether more than 55% of the population support their policy. We can do a formal hypothesis test for this.
