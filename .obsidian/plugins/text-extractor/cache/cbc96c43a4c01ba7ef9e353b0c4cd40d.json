Let X be the random variable representing the sum of the faces of the two dice. a) What are the values of A, B, and C in the table below, that gives the probability mass function of X ? x 23 456 7 8 9 10 11 12 P(X = x) 1 36 2 36 3 36 4 36 5 36 AB C 3 36 2 36 1 36 b) Calculate P(X > 10). c) Compute E[X ]. d) Compute Var(X ). Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University Revision – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Bayes Theorem In a particular hepatology clinic, about 30% of patients have been diagnosed with liver disease. Of the patients that have been diagnosed with liver disease, 80% of them consume alcohol excessively, while 10% of the patients that have not been diagnosed with liver disease drink excessively. For a patient selected at random a) what is the probability that they drink excessively? b) what is the probability that they have liver disease, given they drink excessively? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University Revision – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Poisson Random Variables In a call centre, the number of calls an attendant answers follows a Poisson distribution with a mean of 5 calls per hour. The company has 8 attendants. a) What is the probability that an attendant answers only one call in one hour? b) What is the probability that an attendant answers at least one call in one hour? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University Revision – ST221 Introduction to Statistics The Normal Distribution The weight, in kg, of ﬁsh in a lake follows a normal distribution with mean 20 and standard deviation 2. a) What is the probability that a randomly selected ﬁsh weighs less than 21kg? b) What is the probability that a randomly selected ﬁsh weighs more than 21kg? c) What is the probability that a randomly selected ﬁsh weighs between 19kg and 21kg? d) What is the probability that a randomly selected ﬁsh weighs exactly 20kg? Dr Rafael Moral Maynooth University Revision – ST221 Introduction to Statistics Hypothesis Testing To study the eﬃcacy of a diet, ﬁve people’s weights were recorded before they started the diet and six months later. These are the results: Before 80 70 65 95 100 After 72 69 67 81 88 ¯xs Diﬀerence 8 1 \u0000214 12 6.6 6.91 Assuming that the populations are normally distributed, test the hypothesis that the diet is eﬀective and promotes weight loss. a) State the null and alternative hypotheses. Explain the notation you use. b) Calculate the test statistic. c) Compute the p-value. d) State the conclusions.
