### Theme: A Sustainable Environment


#### POIs
- Electric Scooters
	- Efficiency, Energy use, byproducts and recycling
- Noise Pollution
	- Physical and Mental effects on people
- **Renewable Energy**
	- 42% Energy generated was renewable [in Ireland](https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-eii/environmentalindicatorsireland2022/energy/)
	- Wind energy resources are four times over average in Europe
	- See more [here][https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032109000252/pdfft?md5=7e5cf3d41571da2182dee546d8548eb7&pid=1-s2.0-S1364032109000252-main.pdf]
- ### Nature Preservation
	- Using synthesis to generate sounds of birds, wind in trees, rain, etc.
	- Applications in therapeutical settings
	- Can be used to preserve an aspect of nature that is being destroyed
	- In large urban environments, can be used to synthesise a natural atmosphere and overwrite an urban one (Traffic, Noise)

## Screening (Project Proposal)
---
- Describe idea in 400 words.
- Make it easy to read and understand. 
- Mention functionality and provide links if necessary.
- Written in own words no useless jargon.
- Should have thematic focus

I'm going to make an ambience / noise generator using multiple layers of samples to try and emulate the sounds found in forests or other natural areas. Almost every day acres upon acres of forests are destroyed and I feel that preserving this aspect of nature is important and ties in with the project theme.

The app will have controls for the volumes of each sound / layer through sliders on the main UI. Users will also be able to use their own sounds by adding them to the specific folders in the processing project. I also intend to add a visualisation for the audio the app outputs in the centre of the screen.

I've already got a lot of experience with audio development and production, so I know how to implement the more difficult aspects like the audio visualiser and the UI parameters. If I have the time available, I would also love to synthesize audio on demand for something more realistic (although this may not end up in the final project)

Libraries I'll end up using
LazyGUI: https://github.com/KrabCode/LazyGui
Sound library: See processing 4 Library Manager
