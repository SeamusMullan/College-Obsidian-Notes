#compsys
- Computer origin: Calculating equations, tables, etc.
	-  Originally done by hand
	- Binary (digital format) can be used to calculate almost everything
- General Types
	- Laptop / Mobile Computers
	- Desktop
	- Server
	- Smartphones
	- Comms systems (routers, APs, "The Backbones")
	- Embedded Systems (Cars, Planes, Cameras, etc.)
- Uses
	- Business (Comms, Finance)
	- Government (Internal, Military)
	- Education (VLEs, Online Platforms)
	- etc.

### Fundamental Computing Model

Input -> Processing / {Storage} -> Output

eg:
Keyboard -> Insert Char into file / {Save file to disk} -> display updates

#### *Speed is important: 80ms is the longest before things aren't **instant***

#### External Devices
- Headphones / Audio
- Adapters
#### Internal Devices
- CPU (Central Processing Unit)
	- Speed measured in Gigahertz (GHz) \[Usually 1 - 5 GHz]

- GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
	- Outputs Video using HDMI, DisplayPort, etc.

- RAM (Random Access Memory)
	- Stores program data
	- Very Fast
	- Dynamic (empties after power removed)

- Motherboard (Type of PCB)
	- BUSes
		- PCI / PCIe
			- GPU and Other Devices
		- M.2
			- SSDs
		- SATA
			- Hard Drives / Solid State Disks

- Power Supply
	- Supplies other components with power
	- Needed to convert local voltages (240v / 110v) to usable voltages

-  Cooling (Air, Water or Passive)

- Storage (SSD / Hard Disk Drive)
	- Permanent storage
	- Solid State made of Transistors

- I/O Management
	- General Purpose (USB / Thunderbolt)
	- Video (HDMI, DisplayPort, DVI, VGA)
	- Audio (3.5mm, RCA, Optical, etc.)
	- Networking (Ethernet, POE, Wifi Antennas)

### Binary and Programming

Without code, computers do nothing. They need to be programmed to perform a task / series of tasks.

**Simple binary instructions enable**
- Sequences of Operations
- Repetition of Operations
- Selection of different Operations
**Which can work on**
- Arithmetic and Strings
	- Strings are represented using ASCII / UNICODE
- Other Binary Data

### What can't be computed
Comes under in **Theory of Computation**

- Some calculations that take too long (see Big O Notation)
	- Travelling Salesman Problem
	- Known as Infeasible (Theoretically Possible)

- Some solutions without mathematical solution (can't program if you don't know the answer)
	- 3 Body Problem from Astrophysics

- Some Calculations are just unknown
	- Collatz Conjecture
		- Pick a number,
		- if even, divide by 2
		- if odd, * 3 and add 1
		- repeat
		- do you always end up with one?
