# Making Models for basic systems

- draw schematic diagram
- use physics to write equations
- parameterise the model using experiments
- validate the model (not done in ee123)

## Static Systems

Resistors $\to v = Ri$
changing the voltage means an instant change in current (static)

Key laws:
- KVL
- KCL
