Power Delivering Component
$$P_{v_{1}} = I_{1} \times V_{1}$$


Power Consuming / Absorbing Component (Resistors)
$$P_{V_{1}} = -I_{1} \times V_{1}$$

Assume a resistor $R$ with a potential difference $V$ across it. The power can be written as
$$\displaylines{
P = \frac{V^2}{R} = I^2R = IV}
$$
By computing the current in a circuit, we can compute all the power as the following
![[Class 12 EX1.svg]]
$$P_{V_{1}} = V_{1} \times I$$

Since current = V / R
$$I = \frac{V_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}$$
$$P_{R_{1}} = I^2R_{1}$$ $$P_{R_{2}} = I^2R_{2}$$
$$P_{R_{1}} + P_{R_{2}} = \frac{V_{1}^2}{R_{1}+R_{2}} = P_{V_{1}}$$
Since $V_{1}\times I = P_{V_{1}}$ & $P_{R_{1}} + P_{R_{2}} = P_{V_{1}}$, we can say the
