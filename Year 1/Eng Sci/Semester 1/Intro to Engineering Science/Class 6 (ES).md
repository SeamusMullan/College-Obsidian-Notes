## Electrostatics
---
Deals with electricity at rest

If electrons are removed from a body, it is let with a positive charge. If electrons are added the body becomes negatively charges. These terms are positive / negative electrification. The total deficiency / excess is known as the charge.

**Repelling / Attracting Force can be shown with Coulomb's Law**
$$\displaylines{

F \propto \frac{Q_1Q_2}{d^2} = \frac{kQ_1Q_2}{d^2}
}$$
$k$ is Coulomb's constant. Equal to $$k = 9\times10^9 Nm^2/c^2$$

Coulombs are considered too big of a unit to use for electrostatics, so units like micro-coulombs ( $\micro C$ ) or micro-micro-coulombs ( $\micro \micro C$ )

Micro $\to 10^{-6}$ and Micro-Micro $\to 10^{-12}$
