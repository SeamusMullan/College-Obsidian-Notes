### Resistors in series
for each resistor $R_1, R_2, R_3, ..., R_n$, each resistor has the same current but with a voltage drop.

Total resistance over the resistors $R = R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_n$

**Voltage drop** is notated $V_1, V_2, ..., V_n$ and represents the difference between voltages at points in the circuit. This is *Equal* to the Voltage of the power source

$$\text{Ohm's law can be written as }R = \frac{V}{I}$$
I is constant for the whole circuit, the resistance of a single resistor can be found by this equation, as can the voltage drop following the equations below.

$$
\displaylines{
R_n = \frac{V_n}{I} \\
V_n = I \times R_n
}
$$
### Resistors in Parallel

Voltage same across all resistors, different resistors have different currents
Branched currents add to create total current


When resistors in parallel, Total resistance is written as $$\frac{1}{R}= \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + ... + \frac{1}{R_n}$$
In parallel, the resistors all have the same voltage drop with different currents.

### Non Linear Resistors

Varistor, Thermistor, Incandescent Lamp, Silicon Diode, etc...

##### Varistor
Decreases resistance with voltage

##### Thermistor
Negative coeff of resistance


### Short Circuits
0 Resistance, no voltage drop,
