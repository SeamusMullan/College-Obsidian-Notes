**We will only be doing passive networks. (No active components like transistors)**

#### Definitions
---
- Circuit
	- Closed Conducting path through electric current flows or intends to flow
- Parameters
	- Elements in a circuit which can be lumped or distributed.
- Linear Circuit
	- Circuit 


Kirchhoff's Laws
---
Point law / Current Law
	- In any network, the algebraic sum of the currents at a point / junction is zero
Mesh Law / Voltage Law
	- The algebraic sum of the products of currents and resistances in each of the conductors in any closed path (or mesh) in a network plus the algebraic sum of the voltages in that path is zero.
