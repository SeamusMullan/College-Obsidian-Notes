## Electric Current & Resistors


### Electric Current and Charges

##### SI unit of charge is the **Coulomb**

1 Ampere = 1 Coulomb per second

$1A = 1C/sec$


Electrons available per $m^3$ of conductor is written as $n$ electrons
Axial drift = $dt$, where $dt$ is a small period of time
Axial Drift Velocity = $v$ $m/s$
Distance travelled = $v \times dt$

Assuming cross-sectional area $A$ in a wire, the volume now equals $Av \times dt$

The number of electrons contained in this area is $$nAv \times dt$$
Assuming electrons have a charge $e$, we can say the charge that crosses the section in the period $dt$ is
$$
dq = enAv \times dt
$$

##### Current
is the rate of flow of charge, written as $i$, which is equal to
$$
i = \frac{dq}{dt} = \frac{enAv \times dt}{dt} = enAv
$$
##### Speed of light / Energy
AKA, Speed of propagation of electric fields
its roughly $3x10^8$
Fancy names lol

### Resistance

##### How to Read Resistors

#### Resistance
is a property of a substance which opposes the flow of electric current

Opposite of a conductor (Material with low resistance) is an Insulator (Material with high resistance)

Eg:
- Wood is more resistive than metal
- A thicker cable has a higher resistance than a thin one
	- Extra note: the smaller one allows less current through it (Forget about lightbulbs lol)

#### Ohms
The unit of resistance, which can be represented in the following equations / relations$$R = \frac{V}{I}$$$$R \propto \frac{l}{A}$$
$$R = \frac{\rho l}{A}$$
