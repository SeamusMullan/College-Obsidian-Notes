## Conductance and Conductivity

Conductance is the opposite of Resistance. Conductance measures the inducement which it offers to its flow (how much it helps it flow). The equation is as follows where G is conductivity

$$
G = \frac{A}{\rho l} = \frac{\sigma A}{l}
$$

##### The unit of **conductance** is Siemens and the unit of **conductivity** is Siemens/meter $S/m$

## Ohm's Law

$$
\displaylines{
V = IR\\
V \to \text{Potential Difference} \\
I \to Current \\
R \to Resistance \\ \\

\frac{V_1 - V_2}{1}\\
\text{This ratio is contsant, if } V_1 - V_2 \text{ changes, so does the bottom}\\
\text{Also, }\frac{V}{I} = R \text{ and provided that R }\\
\text{stays constant, the relationship is proportional between V and I}
}
$$
Note: This is like important and stuff, so learn and memorise it!

These rules also apply for series resistors, say for example
$R = R_1 + R_2 + R_3$

With a circuit of current I, we can calculate the potential difference (voltage) over the individual resistors by doing the following

$V_{R_1} = I \times R_1$
This stays true for the other resistors and their combinations since they are additive.

Applied voltage = sum of different voltage drops
- Voltage drops occur over resistances

## Power
The amount of joules being used per second, a.k.a. $$P = V \times I = I^2 \times R = \frac{V^2}{R}$$
This is considers the power being consumed by the circuit

Example:

Three resistors in series over a 12 v battery
R1 = 1 ohm
r2 has a voltage drop of 4v
r3 has a dissipation of 12 watts
