## Field Strength & Electric Intensity
---
Force Experienced at a point inside an electric field with a positive or negative charge.

**Definition 1:** The force experience by a unit positive charge placed at that point. Its direction is the direction along which the force acts

If a charge of $Q_2$ is placed at a point $p$ in an electric field with a force of $F$ newtons then the electric field at that point is given by,
$$E = \frac{F}{Q_2}$$

---
For Electric Intensity
$$E = \frac{k\times \tilde{Q}}{d^2}$$

---

**Definition 2:** Elec. Intensity = the number of lines of force per unit area.

With a positive charge $Q$ , draw a sphere around the charge. The num of lines produced from the charge is $$\frac{Q}{\epsilon}$$ $\epsilon$ is known as the dielectric permittivity.

At a distance $d$, the number of lines per unit area is also equal to $$\frac{Q}{\epsilon}$$

We can then determine that $$\epsilon = \frac{4}{4 \pi d^2}$$ // unfinished ^^

**Definition 3:** Elec. Intensity at any point in a field is equal to the rate of fall of potential in the direction of the lines of force $$E = \frac{-dV}{dx}$$
Links to **Potential Gradient** which represents the falloff of the intensity of the potential with distance.$$dV = E \times -dx$$

### Gauss's Law

Note: Q is the sum of all the fields inside ( $Q_1 + Q_2 + Q_3 + ... + Q_n$ )

Net electrical flux through any closed surface (Any Shape) is equal to $$\frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \times Q$$
where $\epsilon_0$ is Vacuum Permittivity ( $8.854x10^{-12}$ $F/m$ )

The electric field $E$ equals $$\frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r^2}$$

Electrical Potential
---

An isolated positive charge $Q$ placed in air has an electrostatic field which can technically go to infinity.

If the charge $X$ is very far away from $Q$, a force of repulsion acts upon it. At a distance of Infinity, this is practically 0 and as $X$ gets closer to $Q$, the force increases, meaning work / energy is required to bring $X$ to a point closer than infinity (Assume it's $A$ ). Hence, when $X$ is a point $A$, $X$ has an amount of electrical potential energy which is allowing it to be closer to $Q$.

Note: the work done to move it to $A$ is considered the electrical potential. $X$ will not exist at $A$ forever since $Q$ is exerting a force upon it. $X$ would require a continuous supply of force to stay at $A$
