      "content": "Sure! Here are some additional terminology related to functions:\n\n1. Range: The set of all possible outputs or values that a function can produce. In other words, it is the set of all elements in the second set (B) that are mapped to by the function.\n\n2. Image: The actual output or value that a specific input is mapped to by the function. It is the result of applying the function to a particular element in the domain.\n\n3. Codomain: The set of all possible outputs or values that a function can produce. It is similar to the range, but it includes all possible values that the function could potentially map to, even if they are not actually mapped to by any element in the domain.\n\n4. One-to-One Function: A function in which each element in the domain is mapped to a unique element in the codomain. In other words, no two different elements in the domain are mapped to the same element in the codomain.\n\n5. Onto Function: A function in which every element in the codomain is mapped to by at least one element in the domain. In other words, the range of the function is equal to the codomain.\n\n6. Injective Function: Another term for a one-to-one function.\n\n7. Surjective Function: Another term for an onto function.\n\n8. Bijective Function: A function that is both one-to-one and onto. In other words, each element in the domain is mapped to a unique element in the codomain, and every element in the codomain is mapped to by exactly one element in the domain.\n\n9. Composite Function: A function that is formed by combining two or more functions. The output of one function becomes the input of the next function in the composition.\n\n10. Inverse Function: A function that \"undoes\" the action of another function. If a function f maps elements from set A to set B, then its inverse function, denoted as f^(-1), maps elements from set B back to set A.\n\nThese are some additional terms related to functions. Let me know if you need further clarification on any of them!",
