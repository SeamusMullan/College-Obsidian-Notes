Limits Recap
---

The limit of a function $f(x)$ at $c$ = $L$, can be written as $$\lim_{x\to c} f(x) = L$$ Values of f(x) can be made arbitrarily close to $L$ by restricting $x$ sufficiently close to $c$ 
(but not equal to $c$)

We can use $\epsilon$ (Epsilon a.k.a small fucking number) as a target margin of error. By choosing a small enough delta ($\delta$, distance from c) we can get our answer to reach $\epsilon$.

Some scenarios like $f(x) = sin(\frac{1}{x})$ can produce outputs where we cannot get within $\epsilon$

Examples

$$\lim_{x\to 1} (\frac{x^3 - x}{x - 1})$$


Continuity
---

The idea of making gentle / gradual changes to things and observing what gets conserved.

eg function with smooth graph (sum of a few sine waves), should be possible to turn the domain into the graph by gradually deforming the domain into it. These functions are continuous and can be imagined as a big long string.

A function that has "tears / ruptures" eg the step function make this impossible since the "string" gets broken at 0. These functions are called

This can be simplified to say;
**Where the output of a function and the limit of this function are equal, the function is continuous.**

All polynomials are continuous at all points on the real line, rational functions may have points where they are not defined, but are continuous at all other points.
