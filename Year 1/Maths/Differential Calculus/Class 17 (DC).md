Infinite Limits
---
*why we have closed intervals in limits...*

$f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$  where x $\in$ $(0, \infty)$ 

$$
\displaylines{
f(0) = undefined\\
f(1) = 1 \\
f(2) = \frac{1}{2} \\
\text{the other way} \\
f(\frac{1}{3}) = 3 \\
f(\frac{1}{10}) = 10 \\
}
$$

As x approaches 0 from the right hand side, the values approach infinity. This behaviour is asymptotic and means we cant have a value for x that is on the y-axis.

$$\displaylines{
\lim_{x\to 0} f(x) = \infty \\
}$$

$\lim_{x\to c} f(x) = \pm \infty$ means that $f(x)$ has a vertical asymptote
