## Building functions from simple parts

Note: Most are $F: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$

- $x \to mx + c$
	- Simple Line
	- $m$ represents slope
	- $f(x) = c \text{ is constant}$
- $x \to x^2$
	- Parabola Shape
	- Symmetry along y axis
- $x \to x^3$
	- Inverted parabola for negative numbers
	- Symmetry through origin
- $x \to |x|$
	- See [[Class 2 (DC)]]
- $x \to \frac{1}{x}$
	- $F:\mathbb{R}\setminus{0}  \to \mathbb{R}$
		- Real numbers excluding Zero
	- Gets Smaller as inputs get bigger
	- Gets bigger as inputs get smaller
	- Never truly hits axes, gets arbitrarily close

See above for what modifications do to the same function (Translating, Stretching, etc.)
