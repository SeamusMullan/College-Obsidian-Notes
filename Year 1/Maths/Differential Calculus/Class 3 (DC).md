### More MF Functions

function $f$ involves associating elements between sets (domain and codomain)
$f: \mathbb{A} \rightarrow \mathbb{B}$
Function has a rule, every input in $\mathbb{A}$ is mapped to an output in $\mathbb{B}$
See [[Class 2 (DC)]] for more info

Rule can be given by a list, mathematical equation, piecewise defined (see Absolute Value function[[Class 2 (DC)]] )

## Graphs
Cartesian Plane created by $\mathbb{R}^2$ which is literally all the real numbers times all the real numbers.
See [[Class 0 (LA)]] for more info

Written $f =$ { $(x, y) \in \mathbb{A} \times \mathbb{B}$ }
Shape described as a Parabola, Shape of the graph can be used to find $f(x)$ since the coordinated are displayed as ( $x, f(x)$ )

Piecewise functions can be problematic, especially when two values overlap. This can cause a function to map one input to two outputs (Not a function)

The following "function" is written as 

$$
\displaylines{
f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \\ 
x \rightarrow
\begin{cases}
      x^2 + 1 & \text{x > 2}\\
      -3x & \text{2 < x}
    \end{cases} 
}
$$
This overlaps at 2, causing a jump which no longer makes this function valid.

A general test for functions to check if they are valid is the **Vertical Line test** which checks that a vertical line only crosses the function once

### 1-to-1 functions (Injective)
$f:A\to B$
Where all of the inputs have a unique output.
