## Functions
are used to relate elements of sets to each other

$A, B \text{ are both sets}$
A function, $f$ for example, is a way of associating to each element in $A$, a unique element in $B$ 

For Example:

$A = \mathbb{N} = {1, 2, 3, ...}$
$B = \mathbb{N}$
$f(x) \text{ takes an input from A and sends it to the corresponding value in B following a rule}$

#### The Rule
is *what happens* to $x$ or where it is mapped to from set $A$ to set $B$
eg: $f(x) = x^2 +2x +3$

Note: Not all element in $B$ has to receive / be mapped to by an element of $A$
eg:
if $f(x) = x + 3$, all values in $B$ under 3 will not be mapped to

Depending on the rule, it may be difficult to define exactly what the range of a function is. It is usually easier to define a large codomain in which the range lives. This is why we use different terms for the range and codomain.

The range of a function $f$ is not always equal to the Codomain. It's nice when it is, and its called an ONTO function or a Surjective Function

### Terminology

Domain: The first set, whose elements are known as inputs.

Codomain: The second set, whose elements get mapped to (see range). Not all elements may be mapped to

Range: The outputs after a set goes through a function. The range is a subset of the Codomain

Onto function / Surjective function: A function where the range is equal to the codomain

### Example

The absolute value function ( $|x|$ )

$$
\displaylines{
f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \\ 
x \rightarrow
\begin{cases}
      x & \text{if x > 0}\\
      -x & \text{if x < 0}\\
      0 & \text{if x = 0}
    \end{cases} 
}
$$
There are multiple rules but they all combine to map to the real numbers
