Evaluating functions
---

take $f(x) = 7x^2-3x+1$ 
find $f(2) = 23$
This is simple to do, its just subbing numbers in. It's simple because its a polynomial

With a rational function
$$f(x) = \frac{q(x)}{p(x)}$$
Solve again, its just subbing in numbers, same outcome.

#### Difficult Evaluations

Something less easy could be $f(x) =  \sqrt{x}$ 
$f(9)$ might be easy, but $f(2)$ is a lot more difficult

There's many options (Trig / Pythagoras, Solving $x^2 - 2 = 0$)

We can only approximate this, we can split our number line up and say $\sqrt{2}$ is between 1 and 2. then we can check numbers in our equation $x^2 - 2 = 0$ and check if they are negative or positive. We can keep splitting up this interval and check if $\frac{3}{2}$ is greater or less, we can do it on the other side, again and again and again.

By doing this we get closer and closer to the actual value of $\sqrt{2}$ but we can't ever get it **exactly**.

This, is called a limit.
