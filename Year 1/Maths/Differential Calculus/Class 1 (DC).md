Notion of num line (abstract)

Think in terms of distances
units away from zero
whole number, fractions see [[Class 0 (DC)]] for sets / elements

beginning was assumption numbers can be demonstrated as fractions
proven wrong, Pythagoras, $\sqrt{2}$, etc

$\sqrt{2} \text{ is not rational and cant be expressed as integers in the form }a/ b$

Therefore, we get Real Numbers ( Expressed as $\mathbb{R}$ )
aka. all the decimals

finite
1/2 -> 0.5
1/4 -> 0.25

infinite
1/3 -> 0.333333.....
repeating block

can be returned into fraction form
#### Every decimal which terminates as a "repeating block" is a rational number (Expressible as a fraction)

*eg*

$x = 0.131313131313...$
block -> 13
shift the block left

---
$100x = 13.13131313$ 
$x = 0.13131313$ 
$100x - x = 99x$
$99x = 13$
---
$x = 0.215721572157$
$10000x = 2157.2157...$
$9999x = 2157$
$x = 2157/9999$


Most decimals do not terminate as a repeating block
irrational numbers are decimals that don't terminate as a repeating block
*examples $\pi$, $e \text{ and }\sqrt{2}$

Note:
$\pi \text{ is a ratio between circumference and diameter of a circle}$

$\mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}$
This is called a completion

Calculus -> getting arbitrarily close to infinite numbers like irrational numbers

## Interval Notation

Interval -> numbers on num line between points A and B
$a < b$
$a, b \in \mathbb{R}$

General Rule
() -> strict             (Open Interval)
\[] -> inclusive       (Closed Interval)

$(a, b)$ -> {$x \in \mathbb{R} : a < x < b$}
\[a, b] -> {$x \in \mathbb{R} : a \le x \le b$}
(a, $\infty$) -> {$X \in \mathbb{R} : x > a$}

---
## Set Notation

Union -> elements in both sets
$$ x \cup y$$
elements
$$x\cap y$$

$(0, 1) \cap (7,9) = \varnothing$
$(-\infty, 1) \cup (-1, \infty)$ = $\mathbb{R}$
