#### Not Polynomials
---
$$
\displaylines{
f(x) = x^n \text{ where } n<0 \\
f:A \to B \text{ where } A, B \text{ not} \in \mathbb{R} \\
}
$$

### Rational Functions
---
**Form of Rational functions:** $$
\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} \text{ where } p(x), q(x) \text{ are polynomials}
$$
Quotients give risk of dividing by zero, means domain must be defined.

### Trigonometric Functions
---
**Generally to do with Right-Angle Triangles or Unit Circle**


Maps the number line around the origin in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and the distance on the number line represents and angle that a point on the circle is to the origin. This goes from 0 $\to$ $2\pi$ and then repeats. This is called a **Periodic** function.

Some important functions
$$
\displaylines{
\text{ For an angle t in the function A(t)} \to \text{(x, y)}\\

sin(x) \to \text{ Vertical Component}\\
cos(x) \to \text{ Horizontal Component}\\
\text{Now we can write A(t) as ( cos(t), sin(t) )}\\ \\

tan(x)\\

}
$$
