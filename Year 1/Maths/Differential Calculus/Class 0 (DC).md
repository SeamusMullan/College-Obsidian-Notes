##### Sets of Numbers
$\mathbb{N}$ - Natural Numbers {$1, 2, 3, ...$}
$\mathbb{Z}$ - Integers {$..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$}
$\mathbb{Q}$ - Rational Numbers { $a/b : a.b \in  \mathbb{Z} : b \neq 0$ }
$\mathbb{R}$ - Real Numbers { $\mathbb{Q} \text{ and all decimals }$}

##### Prime Decomposition
- Break down number into a series of prime numbers multiplied together
	- $20$ -> $4 \times 5$-> $2^2 \times 5$
- Can expand into a much more complex scenarios / questions
	- $M = (P_{1}, P_{2}, \ldots , P_{n}) + 1$
