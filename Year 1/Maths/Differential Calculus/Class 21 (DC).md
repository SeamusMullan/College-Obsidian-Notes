Limits of Limits or something

$$\lim_{h\to h}\frac{f(x_0 + h)-f(x_0)}{h}$$
Get the limit of $h$ in this function



$$f'(c)  = \\lim_{ h \to 0 } \frac{ f(x_0 + h)-f(x_0) } { h }$$

$$f'(c) \text{ is the line tangent to point c on the curve } f(x)$$
A.k.a the slope at an *exact* point (not technically)

## Differentiation
is the process of computing $f'(c)$ (if it exists)
