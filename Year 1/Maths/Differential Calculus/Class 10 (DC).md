Sin and Cos. Both periodic. Means they repeat with a period.

$sin(t) = sin(t) + 2n\pi$  for any whole number n (the $2n\pi$ represents full turns around the circle)

$-sin(t) = sin(t)$ and the same for cos(t)


Slope of hypotenuse. Assume $(-\frac{\pi}{2} < t < \frac{\pi}{2})$ to stop this (slope of vertical line is undefined)

Slope of Hypotenuse = $tan(t) = \frac{sin(t)}{cos(t)}$ Stands out since it does not work with all inputs (see range above). Vertical lines cause an undefined solution

This means the largest subset of $\mathbb{R}$ where tan(t) functions is ( $\mathbb{R} \setminus t\in\mathbb{R }, t = 2n+1\times \frac{\pi}{2}$ )


Sin and Cos are not one-to-one, so they cannot be inverted
to invert sin, we restrict the domain to $[-\frac{\pi}{2} < t < \frac{\pi}{2}]$ which includes the two 'problem values' from the original function. For cos we use $(0 < t < \pi)$ since it's offset 90 degrees

inverse sin, arc sin and $sin^{-1}$ are all the same thing, same with cos and tan and all the other crap
