# Finding Maxima and Minima

To find the local maxima and minima of a function, we can use calculus. Here's a step-by-step process:

## 1. Find the Derivative
First, find the first derivative of the function. This derivative represents the rate of change of the function.

For a function \($f(x)$ \), the first derivative is denoted as \( $f'(x)$ \) or \( $\frac{df}{dx}$).

## 2. Set the Derivative Equal to Zero
Next, solve for the points where the first derivative is equal to zero.

$f'(x) = 0$

These points are where the function has a horizontal tangent line and are potential candidates for maxima or minima.

## 3. Solve for Critical Points
Solve the equation \( $f'(x) = 0$ \) to find the critical points. These points are where the function could potentially have a maximum or minimum.

## 4. Use the Second Derivative Test
To determine whether a critical point is a maximum, minimum, or neither, use the second derivative test if applicable.

Calculate the second derivative \( $f''(x)$ \).

For a critical point \( $c$ \):

- If \( $f''(c) > 0$ \), the function has a local minimum at \( $c$ \).
- If \( $f''(c) < 0$ \), the function has a local maximum at \( $c$ \).
- If \( $f''(c) = 0$ \), the test is inconclusive, and we may need to use other methods to determine the nature of the critical point.

## 5. Analyse Endpoints (if necessary)
If the function is defined on a closed interval, evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval as well. Sometimes, global maxima or minima can occur at these endpoints.

## 6. Compare Values
Finally, compare the values of the function at all critical points and endpoints (if any) to determine the absolute highest and lowest values of the function on the interval.

## Example
Let's consider the function \( $f(x) = x^2$ \) on the interval \( $[-1, 2]$\ ).

1. Find the derivative: \( $f'(x) = 2x$\)
2. Set the derivative to zero: \( $2x = 0$ \) implies \( $x = 0$ \)
3. Solve for critical points: The critical point here is \( $x = 0$ \)
4. Use the second derivative test: \( $f''(x) = 2$ \), which is positive, so \( $x = 0$ \) is a minimum.
5. Analyse endpoints: \( $f(-1) = 1$ \) and \( $f(2) = 4$ \)
6. Compare values: The minimum value is \( $f(0) = 0$ \), and the maximum value on the interval is \( $f(2) = 4$ \).

By following these steps, we can identify the maxima and minima of a function.
