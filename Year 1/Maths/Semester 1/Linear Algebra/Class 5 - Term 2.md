Bound and Free variables
---

Variables that are leading ones in REF matrices are called bound variables. For each of these we have one equation, meaning they are bound to 1 equation.

In columns with no leading ones, each of the variables in that column are known as free variables. this is because back substitution only gives us values for bound variables.
