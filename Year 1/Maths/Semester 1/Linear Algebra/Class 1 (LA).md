Coordinates represented as a tuple, coordinates in different dimensions with $n$ planes are written as 
$x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$

## Systems of Linear Equations
---
### Equations with one unknown
*eg: $\frac{1}{2}x = 3$ where $\frac{1}{2}x$ is the unknown*

All linear equations with one unknown can be represented as (has the symbolic form)
$ax = b$ where $a$ is a coefficient, $b$ is a constant and $x$ is a variable

These can be solved by letting $x = \frac{b}{a}$ assuming $a \neq 0$
When $a = 0$ there are **no solutions**
When $a \text{ and } b = 0$, every value for $x$ is a solution

### Equations with two unknowns

Symbolic Form: $ax + by + c$
$a \to \text{coefficient of x}$
$b \to \text{coefficient of y}$
$c \to \text{constant}$

eg: for temperature conversion (Celsius $\to$ Fahrenheit)
$$\frac{c}{5} = \frac{f-32}{9}$$
can be written as 
$$\frac{1}{5}c + (\frac{-1}{9})f = \frac{-32}{9}$$
In which both $\frac{1}{5}$ and $\frac{-1}{9}$ are coefficients
