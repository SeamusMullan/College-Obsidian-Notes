#### High level Overview
*Linear Algebra = Connection between geometry and numbers*

- Coordinate Geometry
- Linear Equations  $y = mx + c$  shit, but like, more
	- Smth called Gaussian Elimination
- Matrices
	- Vectors
	- Arrays of Numbers n' Shit
	- $\begin{bmatrix}   1 & 2 & 3\\   a & b & c   \end{bmatrix}$
	- Storing and Manipulating Data

## Coordinate Geometry

1, 2, 3 dimensions

$\mathbb{N}$ -> Natural Numbers {$1, 2, 3, ...$}
$\mathbb{Z}$ -> Integers {$..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$}
$\mathbb{Q}$ -> Rational Numbers { $a/b : a.b \in  \mathbb{Z} : b \neq 0$ }
$\mathbb{R} - \mathbb{Q}$ -> Irrational Numbers
$\mathbb{C}$ - Complex Numbers 

$$|x| = {
[x \text{ if }  x>= 0]
}
$$

### 1 Dimension

- Distance between two points $= |x_1 - x_2|$
- One copy of the real number line (x axis)


### 2 Dimensions

Model = Cartesian Plane
- Can also be written as $\mathbb{R}^2$
- Contains 2 copies of the real number line (x and y axis)
- Meet @ Origin (0, 0)

Distance between 2 points = Pythagoras' Theorem =

### 3 Dimensions

Model = $\mathbb{R}^3$

3 Copies of the Real Number Line (x, y and z axes)
